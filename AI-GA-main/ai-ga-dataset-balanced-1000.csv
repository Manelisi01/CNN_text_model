Protein Disulfide Isomerase and Host-Pathogen Interaction,"

This paper examines the role of Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) in host-pathogen interaction. PDI is a redox enzyme involved in various stages of protein folding, playing an important role in modulating innate immune responses to bacterial infections. Using multiple organisms as models for study, including Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana, we demonstrate that PDI contributes to the elimination of pathogens through both its enzymatic activity and gene-regulation capabilities. We also show that pathogenic bacteria employ strategies to manipulate PDI levels during infection which can result in reduced host defense and increased risk of disease progression. Furthermore, we provide evidence that plants can defend themselves against invasion by engineering their own PDIs capable of direct deterrence or manipulation of the invading microorganisms' physiological environment. Our findings suggest that future therapeutic possibilities targeting this multifaceted protein may offer novel methods for controlling infectious diseases caused by pathogens displaying resistance to existing therapies.",1
Preparation of an antitumor and antivirus agent: chemical modification of α-MMC and MAP30 from Momordica Charantia L. with covalent conjugation of polyethyelene glycol," 

Title: Preparation of an antitumor and antivirus agent: Chemical modification of α-MMC and MAP30 from Momordica Charantia L. with covalent conjugation of polyethylene glycol

Momordica charantia L., commonly known as bitter melon, has a long history in Traditional Chinese Medicine for the treatment of various conditions, including cancer. Extracts from this plant have shown promising anticancer activity in laboratory studies due to their unique active compounds–α-MMC and MAP30. In order to make these components more effective medically and improve their bioavailability, chemical modification is necessary. This study aimed to prepare an efficient antitumor and antivirus therapeutic agent through chemical modification by covalent conjugation between α-MMC/MAP30 obtained from M. charantia extract and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The synthesis process was optimized via controlling emulsified oil phase temperature, reaction time, PEG molecular weight concentration ratio etc.] Successful coupling products were characterized by thin layer chromatography (TLC), infrared spectroscopy (IR) etc., indicating successful characteristic retention after the intensive modifications. From our research results it was found that PEGylated proteins prepared had increased water solubility compared to unmodified proteins when tested using turbidity assays; they also demonstrated notable antiproliferative effect against Lung adenocarcinoma cells A549 with lower IC50 vales than nonmodified protein extracts in vitro.. The successful production then provides potential avenues for drug development derived from natural peptides isolated form M.charantia L and relevant plants species similarly containing such potent active components but suffering bad optimization or low efficacy regarding their application on pharmaceutical aspects yet without appropriate auxiliary measures taken upfront properly speaking .Overall, this result laid the foundation for further investigations into possible mechanisms affected mediating by those newly synthesized peptide derivatives related primarily focusing on evaluation upon medical applications .",1
Diversity and roles of (t)RNA ligases,"

This paper investigates the diversity and roles of tRNA ligases in regulating key cellular processes. The ability of different tRNA ligase families to interact with distinct RNA substrates has long been associated with their great capacity to recognize and act upon a wide variety of nucleotide sequences. More recently, increasing evidence supports contributing influences for other enzymes involved in modifying cytoplasmic RNAs popularly known as (t)RNA ligases. This study provides an overview on the plurality and characteristics of these essential proteins that were screened from more than three hundred sequenced genomes to reveal the overall functional complexity within this category. Findings demonstrate that while some well-defined evolutionary conserved functions exist amongst diverse organisms, equally important biological roles are not exclusive and can vary depending on specific cell lineages or physiological states. Herein we discuss both general themes regarding (t)RNA regulatory mechanisms along with novel insights gleaned from our analyses which provide further details into evolutionarily conserved versus unique distinctions between/within superfamilies as applicable towards multiple species domains including prokaryotes, eukaryotes, plants, animals etc..

Lack of Association between CLEC5A Gene Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms and Kawasaki Disease in Taiwanese Children,"

This study focuses on the lack of association between CLEC5A gene polymorphisms and Kawasaki disease (KD) susceptibility in Taiwanese children. To investigate this, 380 KD patients diagnosed according to American Heart Association criteria were enrolled in a hospital-based case–control study. Genotypes at two SNPs, rs10954213 and rs3760599, located within the CLEC5A gene region were examined by PCR amplification with TaqMan universal assay technology. Statistical analyses were performed to analyze potential associations between these genotypes and KD risk. The results suggest that there was no statistically significant correlation between either SNP and risk for KD after adjusting for age adjustment or sex adjustment among Taiwanese children with KD compared to healthy control subjects. These findings may provide information helpful for elucidating possible genetic predisposing factors involved in the pathogenesis of KD in other populations as well as broaden our understanding of immune-mediated diseases mediated by variations within innate immunity genes",1
Insights into the Evolution and Emergence of a Novel Infectious Disease,"Many zoonotic, novel infectious diseases in humans appear as sporadic infections with spatially and temporally restricted outbreaks, as seen with influenza A(H5N1). Adaptation is often a key factor for successfully establishing sustained human-to-human transmission. Here we use simple mathematical models to describe different adaptation scenarios with particular reference to spatial heterogeneity within the human population. We present analytical expressions for the probability of emergence per introduction, as well as the waiting time to a successful emergence event. Furthermore, we derive general analytical results for the statistical properties of emergence events, including the probability distribution of outbreak sizes. We compare our analytical results with a stochastic model, which has previously been studied computationally. Our results suggest that, for typical connection strengths between communities, spatial heterogeneity has only a weak effect on outbreak size distributions, and on the risk of emergence per introduction. For example, if [Image: see text] or larger, any village connected to a large city by just ten commuters a day is, effectively, just a part of the city when considering the chances of emergence and the outbreak size distribution. We present empirical data on commuting patterns and show that the vast majority of communities for which such data are available are at least this well interconnected. For plausible parameter ranges, the effects of spatial heterogeneity are likely to be dominated by the evolutionary biology of host adaptation. We conclude by discussing implications for surveillance and control of emerging infections.",0
Macroevolutionary Immunology: A Role for Immunity in the Diversification of Animal life,"

This paper presents a survey of the state-of-the–art in macroevolutionary immunology, offering innovative insights on how immunity has shaped animal diversification. Driven by selective pressures that shape individual species, macroevolution occurs over millions of years and is reflected in changes to morphology and physiology. Immunity is found at every level of biological organization and likely plays an important role in this grand scale evolution as well. A rich body of research has explored various aspects of the interaction between immunology and evolutionary biology such as host-pathogen coevolution, functional trade-offs due to immune activation, local adaptation strategies resulting from varying environmental pressures across species range, etc., yet its potential role in major lineage divergence remains largely unexplored. We provide an overview on current knowledge about these mechanisms which underpin macroevolutionary change for animals – their implications for patterns of phenotypic variation within parental taxa are discussed together with future directions to integrate mechanistic approaches into systematics studies.",1
Placement of Leucine Zipper Motifs at the Carboxyl Terminus of HIV-1 Protease Significantly Reduces Virion Production,"

This study evaluates the effectiveness of leucine zipper motifs (LZMs) as an additive to HIV-1 protease carboxyl termini in reducing viral production. With the increasing prevalence of HIV, there is a need to develop new inhibitors that interrupt its life cycle. To achieve this goal, LZMs were placed at key locations on proteases from two clinical isolates and their ability to reduce virion output was studied. Experiments included assessing substrate specificity, translation efficiency assays, reverse transcription quantitative PCR and Western blotting techniques. Results revealed that even minor changes still potentiated significant antiviral effects, offering an effective approach against HIV infection and replication processes which would lead to better treatments for those affected by it. Overall, placement of LZM's at the carboxyl terminus of HIV=1 protease reduced virion production significantly - thus providing potential impetus for further exploration into novel therapies based upon manipulation of essential components in the virus' replication cycle",1
The Ebola Virus Glycoprotein and HIV-1 Vpu Employ Different Strategies to Counteract the Antiviral Factor Tetherin,"

This paper discusses the mechanisms by which the Ebola virus glycoprotein (GP) and human immunodeficiency virus 1-Vpu (HIV-1 Vpu) combat the antiviral factor tetherin. Tetherin is a host protein that restricts release of HIV particles; considering GP and HIV-1 Vpu have differing strategies to counteract its effects on viral replication, understanding their distinct strategies would provide insight into effective measures for controlling both viruses. Previous studies have examined these distinct pathways but their influence on viral replication has been largely underinvestigated in comparison to other established components. This study aims to examine how each viral protein interacts with tetherin and assesses whether mutations in either GP or HIV-1 Vpu lead to differential regulation of this restriction factor resulting in variant levels of vesicle release from cells. Our research will be beneficial as it fills an important knowledge gap regarding how various components interact at a molecular level, ultimately leading us closer toward uncovering effective therapeutics against these pathogens.

"A survey of knowledge, attitudes and practices towards avian influenza in an adult population of Italy","BACKGROUND: Several public health strategic interventions are required for effective prevention and control of avian influenza (AI) and it is necessary to create a communication plan to keep families adequately informed on how to avoid or reduce exposure. This investigation determined the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors relating to AI among an adult population in Italy. METHODS: From December 2005 to February 2006 a random sample of 1020 adults received a questionnaire about socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge of transmission and prevention about AI, attitudes towards AI, behaviors regarding use of preventive measures and food-handling practices, and sources of information about AI. RESULTS: A response rate of 67% was achieved. Those in higher socioeconomic classes were more likely to identify the modes of transmission and the animals' vehicles for AI. Those older, who knew the modes of transmission and the animals' vehicles for AI, and who still need information, were more likely to know that washing hands soap before and after touching raw poultry meat and using gloves is recommended to avoid spreading of AI through food. The risk of being infected was significantly higher in those from lower socioeconomic classes, if they did not know the definition of AI, if they knew that AI could be transmitted by eating and touching raw eggs and poultry foods, and if they did not need information. Compliance with the hygienic practices during handling of raw poultry meat was more likely in those who perceived to be at higher risk, who knew the hygienic practices, who knew the modes of transmission and the animals' vehicles for AI, and who received information from health professionals and scientific journals. CONCLUSION: Respondents demonstrate no detailed understanding of AI, a greater perceived risk, and a lower compliance with precautions behaviors and health educational strategies are strongly needed.",0

Public health preparedness in Alberta: a systems-level study,"BACKGROUND: Recent international and national events have brought critical attention to the Canadian public health system and how prepared the system is to respond to various types of contemporary public health threats. This article describes the study design and methods being used to conduct a systems-level analysis of public health preparedness in the province of Alberta, Canada. The project is being funded under the Health Research Fund, Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research. METHODS/DESIGN: We use an embedded, multiple-case study design, integrating qualitative and quantitative methods to measure empirically the degree of inter-organizational coordination existing among public health agencies in Alberta, Canada. We situate our measures of inter-organizational network ties within a systems-level framework to assess the relative influence of inter-organizational ties, individual organizational attributes, and institutional environmental features on public health preparedness. The relative contribution of each component is examined for two potential public health threats: pandemic influenza and West Nile virus. DISCUSSION: The organizational dimensions of public health preparedness depend on a complex mix of individual organizational characteristics, inter-agency relationships, and institutional environmental factors. Our study is designed to discriminate among these different system components and assess the independent influence of each on the other, as well as the overall level of public health preparedness in Alberta. While all agree that competent organizations and functioning networks are important components of public health preparedness, this study is one of the first to use formal network analysis to study the role of inter-agency networks in the development of prepared public health systems.",0
Resveratrol Inhibits KSHV Reactivation by Lowering the Levels of Cellular EGR-1,"

This paper evaluates the antireactivation effects of resveratrol on Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latency with a focus on early growth response 1 (EGR-1), a key regulator essential for viral reactivation.  With increasing prevalence, KSHV infection continues to be an important global health concern, making strategies for its control increasingly necessary. Research conducted in our laboratory demonstrated that resveratrol may provide novel methods to decrease the progression of this virus and increase therapeutic outcomes.

Title: Resveratrol Inhibits KSHV Reactivation by Lowering the Levels of Cellular EGR-1

The ability for Kaposi's sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) latent infections to reactivate is dependent upon several components, including levels of transcription and posttranscriptional regulators such as early growth response 1(EGR-1). Recent research evaluating natural compounds has led to potential antireactivating effects of resveratrol on KSHV latency made possible due to decreased expression levels or marked attenuation in functions related to these key regulators. The present study aimed at determining if treatment with Resveratrol will modify EGR-1 expression in latently infected cells resulting in reduced viral reactivation. Our findings demonstrate that high concentrations ofresolverol significantly inhibited KSHS recruitment through modulation of cellular EGR 1 mRNA suggesting inhibition exerted via interaction between physiological ligands and molecular pathways regulating reactivation control is possible . Thus we conclude that resolverol could act as a novel therapeutic tool ensuring more efficient control over advance stages development prevention",1
Urbanisation and human health in China: spatial features and a systemic perspective,"

Urbanisation is one of the most pervasive changes in our world today and continues to have a profound effect on human health. This paper examines the implications of urbanisation for public health in agricultural-dependent China, with special attention to spatial features and a systemic perspective. Comprehensive non-survey research was conducted using reported data from 134 cities at county level in 22 provinces over five years (2012–2016). Descriptive statistical analyses were used to identify key factors correlated with human health within a broader framework encompassing both regional and local influences. Our results suggest that while hukou registration system privileges are far reaching, access to basic healthcare resources still varies significantly throughout rural regions, particularly due those located greater distances from urban centres. The findings provide valuable insight into potential disparities among population groups based on either their place of residence or other characteristics associated with migration trends further highlighting the importance of developing wellbeing strategies known for their ability

An insight into the potentially old-wonder molecule—quercetin: the perspectives in foresee,"

This paper presents an investigation into quercetin, a potentially ancient molecule. Its structural complexity and significance has attracted the attention of researchers in recent years for its potential capacitive mechanism in health benefitting areas such as wound healing, anti-inflammatory drug targeting and protection against DNA damage. A holistic interpretation of several experiments to monitor the effects of quercetin on our body at molecular level have been studied here in order to shed light upon new perspectives with this multi purpose natural ‘wonder’ molecule. This article is further presented with underlying research data aiming to establish long lasting impressions over its uses and outcomes when used topically or orally by humans.",1
Differential Response of Primary Alveolar Type I and Type II Cells to LPS Stimulation,"

The continuous exposure to environmental pollutants and the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are a major health concern for millions worldwide. In this study, we investigated the differential response of primary alveolar type I and II cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in order to better understand their interactions within an inflamed environment. Utilizing qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence microscopy, a caspase activity assay as well as flow cytometry techniques, our results revealed a modulation of pro inflammatory cytokine gene expression upon LPS stimuli primarily at the transcriptional level in both cell types with IL-6 having notable higher levels of induction compared to that of TNFα. Subsequent morphological assessment described various apoptotic proinflammatory markers indicating distinct reaction parameters depending on cell type studied with increased CPL2 production highlighted only during Type I responses against LPS stimulation while protein analysis depicted exceptionally high Bcl-3/c levels exclusive exclusively only during Type II activation. Taken together, these findings suggest that primary alveolar epithelium maintains different molecular characteristics intrinsic to epithelial cell type adaptation which ultimately determine its befitting outcome following acute inflammation by LPS activation.",1
"Initial psychological responses to Influenza A, H1N1 (""Swine flu"")","BACKGROUND: The outbreak of the pandemic flu, Influenza A H1N1 (Swine Flu) in early 2009, provided a major challenge to health services around the world. Previous pandemics have led to stockpiling of goods, the victimisation of particular population groups, and the cancellation of travel and the boycotting of particular foods (e.g. pork). We examined initial behavioural and attitudinal responses towards Influenza A, H1N1 (""Swine flu"") in the six days following the WHO pandemic alert level 5, and regional differences in these responses. METHODS: 328 respondents completed a cross-sectional Internet or paper-based questionnaire study in Malaysia (N = 180) or Europe (N = 148). Measures assessed changes in transport usage, purchase of preparatory goods for a pandemic, perceived risk groups, indicators of anxiety, assessed estimated mortality rates for seasonal flu, effectiveness of seasonal flu vaccination, and changes in pork consumption RESULTS: 26% of the respondents were 'very concerned' about being a flu victim (42% Malaysians, 5% Europeans, p < .001). 36% reported reduced public transport use (48% Malaysia, 22% Europe, p < .001), 39% flight cancellations (56% Malaysia, 17% Europe, p < .001). 8% had purchased preparatory materials (e.g. face masks: 8% Malaysia, 7% Europe), 41% Malaysia (15% Europe) intended to do so (p < .001). 63% of Europeans, 19% of Malaysians had discussed the pandemic with friends (p < .001). Groups seen as at 'high risk' of infection included the immune compromised (mentioned by 87% respondents), pig farmers (70%), elderly (57%), prostitutes/highly sexually active (53%), and the homeless (53%). In data collected only in Europe, 64% greatly underestimated the mortality rates of seasonal flu, 26% believed seasonal flu vaccination gave protection against swine flu. 7% had reduced/stopped eating pork. 3% had purchased anti-viral drugs for use at home, while 32% intended to do so if the pandemic worsened. CONCLUSION: Initial responses to Influenza A show large regional differences in anxiety, with Malaysians more anxious and more likely to reduce travel and to buy masks and food. Discussions with family and friends may reinforce existing anxiety levels. Particular groups (homosexuals, prostitutes, the homeless) are perceived as at greater risk, potentially leading to increased prejudice during a pandemic. Europeans underestimated mortality of seasonal flu, and require more information about the protection given by seasonal flu inoculation.",0
Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID): a dynamic birth cohort study,"

This manuscript presents the aims, design and methods of ‘Observational Research in Childhood Infectious Diseases (ORChID)': a dynamic birth cohort study. ORChID is a long-term longitudinal project investigating the epidemiology and determinants of major infectious diseases occurring during early infancy up to 5 years of age in Kyrgyzstan. By following newborns from selected maternity hospitals over time, screening for various infections at specific ages as well as collecting environmental data on hygiene standards and vaccination uptake per family, we seek to gain insight into pathways underlying transmission. Our primary hypothesis suggests that age-specific research into relevant risk factors may prove beneficial when designing interventions against childhood disease. The secondary benefit could be identifying regional hotspots within the country with higher or lower occurrence of particular kinds of infection based on lifestyle habits or other contextual details thus informing medical policy makers regarding preventive measures or targeted treatments on local levels. To this end we have written informed consent forms approved by Parents/Caregivers alongside ethical approval from our institution's Health Sciences Research Ethics Board committee prior to any field activity such as interviews taking place in participating households across ten rural health districts comprising urban and mountain regions using convenient sampling techniques thereby increasing inclusion accuracy among parents with young children under five years old whose home addresses are geographically known to cover subpopulations most exposed to common infections at certain developmental stages throughout their growth phase in Kyrgyzstan .",1
Activation of the Canonical Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) Pathway during Lung Morphogenesis and Adult Lung Tissue Repair,"

This paper investigates the role of BMP signalling pathways in lung development and tissue regeneration. Despite the highly conserved nature of skeletal and organogenesis, only recently has research begun to uncover specific molecular mechanisms that govern each process. This comprehensive review focuses on recent findings surrounding the activation of canonical Bone Morphogenic Protein (BMP) signalling during both morphogenesis and repair in adult murine lung tissues in vivo. First, we discuss critical events leading to differentiation and self-renewal within stem cells through various stages of embryological development. We then apply this foundational knowledge to current understandings regarding cellular composition differences observed between proximal/distal regions throughout postnatal maturation before elucidating novel evidence linking BMP pathway activity with morphogenetic cell recruitment as well as long term pulmonary maturation. Finally, inhibited BMPs are discussed within postmortem sectioned preparations, representative of regenerative responses associated with extracellular matrix adhesinses or injuries consequent to environmental influences such as acidosis or asbestos exposure respectively.

Calculating the potential for within-flight transmission of influenza A (H1N1),"BACKGROUND: Clearly air travel, by transporting infectious individuals from one geographic location to another, significantly affects the rate of spread of influenza A (H1N1). However, the possibility of within-flight transmission of H1N1 has not been evaluated; although it is known that smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, SARS and seasonal influenza can be transmitted during commercial flights. Here we present the first quantitative risk assessment to assess the potential for within-flight transmission of H1N1. METHODS: We model airborne transmission of infectious viral particles of H1N1 within a Boeing 747 using methodology from the field of quantitative microbial risk assessment. RESULTS: The risk of catching H1N1 will essentially be confined to passengers travelling in the same cabin as the source case. Not surprisingly, we find that the longer the flight the greater the number of infections that can be expected. We calculate that H1N1, even during long flights, poses a low to moderate within-flight transmission risk if the source case travels First Class. Specifically, 0-1 infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 1-3 during an 11 hour flight and 2-5 during a 17 hour flight. However, within-flight transmission could be significant, particularly during long flights, if the source case travels in Economy Class. Specifically, two to five infections could occur during a 5 hour flight, 5-10 during an 11 hour flight and 7-17 during a 17 hour flight. If the aircraft is only partially loaded, under certain conditions more infections could occur in First Class than in Economy Class. During a 17 hour flight, a greater number of infections would occur in First Class than in Economy if the First Class Cabin is fully occupied, but Economy class is less than 30% full. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide insights into the potential utility of air travel restrictions on controlling influenza pandemics in the winter of 2009/2010. They show travel by one infectious individual, rather than causing a single outbreak of H1N1, could cause several simultaneous outbreaks. These results imply that, during a pandemic, quarantining passengers who travel in Economy on long-haul flights could potentially be an important control strategy. Notably, our results show that quarantining passengers who travel First Class would be unlikely to be an effective control strategy.",0
Novel Inhibitor Design for Hemagglutinin against H1N1 Influenza Virus by Core Hopping Method,"

This review paper centers around a novel inhibitor design, developed through the use of a core hopping method, for the Hemagglutinin (HA) protein of group 1 influenza A viruses such as H1N1. Specifically, this article describes and analyses the synthesis of peptide-based HA inhibitors from tricyclic scaffolds and illustrates how to obtain their 3D conformations by molecular modeling and quantum chemical methods. Furthermore, this analysis points to preliminary working models that can be used for further development and work into finding new methods for HA inhibition against H1N1 Influenza Virus and other related species. In sum, this research outreach offers an intriguing prospect in exploring alternative inhibitor designs through core hopping methodology in order to develop more efficient antiviral agents with improved activity towards prevalent infectious diseases such as Influenza caused by HINI virus or other similar pathogens at celular level.",1
Composition and Function of Haemolymphatic Tissues in the European Common Shrew,"BACKGROUND: Studies of wild animals responding to their native parasites are essential if we are to understand how the immune system functions in the natural environment. While immune defence may bring increased survival, this may come at a resource cost to other physiological traits, including reproduction. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild common shrews (Sorex araneus), which produce large numbers of offspring during the one breeding season of their short life span, forgo investment in immunity and immune system maintenance, as increased longevity is unlikely to bring further opportunities for mating. In particular, we predicted that adult shrews, with shorter expected lifespans, would not respond as effectively as young animals to infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined haemolymphatic tissues from wild-caught common shrews using light and transmission electron microscopy, applied in conjunction with immunohistology. We compared composition and function of these tissues in shrews of different ages, and the extent and type of inflammatory reactions observed in response to natural parasitic infections. All ages seemed able to mount systemic, specific immune responses, but adult shrews showed some signs of lymphatic tissue exhaustion: lymphatic follicles in adults (n = 21) were both smaller than those in sub-adults (n = 18; Wald = 11.1, p<0.05) and exhibited greater levels of depletion (Wald = 13.3, p<0.05). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Contrary to our expectations, shrews respond effectively to their natural parasites, and show little indication of immunosenescence as adults. The pancreas of Aselli, a unique lymphoid organ, may aid in providing efficient immune responses through the storage of large numbers of plasma cells. This may allow older animals to react effectively to previously encountered parasites, but infection by novel agents, and eventual depletion of plasma cell reserves, could both still be factors in the near-synchronous mortality of adult shrews observed shortly after breeding.",0
Rotavirus Structural Proteins and dsRNA Are Required for the Human Primary Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cell IFNα Response,"Rotaviruses are the leading cause of severe dehydrating diarrhea in children worldwide. Rotavirus-induced immune responses, especially the T and B cell responses, have been extensively characterized; however, little is known about innate immune mechanisms involved in the control of rotavirus infection. Although increased levels of systemic type I interferon (IFNα and β) correlate with accelerated resolution of rotavirus disease, multiple rotavirus strains, including rhesus rotavirus (RRV), have been demonstrated to antagonize type I IFN production in a variety of epithelial and fibroblast cell types through several mechanisms, including degradation of multiple interferon regulatory factors by a viral nonstructural protein. This report demonstrates that stimulation of highly purified primary human peripheral plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) with either live or inactivated RRV induces substantial IFNα production by a subset of pDCs in which RRV does not replicate. Characterization of pDC responses to viral stimulus by flow cytometry and Luminex revealed that RRV replicates in a small subset of human primary pDCs and, in this RRV-permissive small subset, IFNα production is diminished. pDC activation and maturation were observed independently of viral replication and were enhanced in cells in which virus replicates. Production of IFNα by pDCs following RRV exposure required viral dsRNA and surface proteins, but neither viral replication nor activation by trypsin cleavage of VP4. These results demonstrate that a minor subset of purified primary human peripheral pDCs are permissive to RRV infection, and that pDCs retain functionality following RRV stimulus. Additionally, this study demonstrates trypsin-independent infection of primary peripheral cells by rotavirus, which may allow for the establishment of extraintestinal viremia and antigenemia. Importantly, these data provide the first evidence of IFNα induction in primary human pDCs by a dsRNA virus, while simultaneously demonstrating impaired IFNα production in primary human cells in which RRV replicates. Rotavirus infection of primary human pDCs provides a powerful experimental system for the study of mechanisms underlying pDC-mediated innate immunity to viral infection and reveals a potentially novel dsRNA-dependent pathway of IFNα induction.",0
Red blood cell transfusion in the critically ill patient,"

This article presents an extensive evaluation of the use of Red Blood Cell Transfusion (RBCTx) for critically ill patients. The complexity of this medical treatment highlights the importance to accurately analyse and consider several aspects related to patient characteristics, recipient's condition and transfusion method before deciding whether or not to proceed with with a RBCTx. To reflect on current clinical guidelines influencing individually tailored care and ascertain potential areas in which further research is needed, literature was reviewed over a period from 1996-2018 on the role, efficacy and risks associated with red blood cell transfusions in critical illnesses. Ultimately it is hoped that this study will help provide guidance for future protocol development; helping clinicians ensure optimal safety and benefits for their patients when considering performing a RBCTx",1
Malignant mesothelioma,"Malignant mesothelioma is a fatal asbestos-associated malignancy originating from the lining cells (mesothelium) of the pleural and peritoneal cavities, as well as the pericardium and the tunica vaginalis. The exact prevalence is unknown but it is estimated that mesotheliomas represent less than 1% of all cancers. Its incidence is increasing, with an expected peak in the next 10–20 years. Pleural malignant mesothelioma is the most common form of mesothelioma. Typical presenting features are those of chest pain and dyspnoea. Breathlessness due to a pleural effusion without chest pain is reported in about 30% of patients. A chest wall mass, weight loss, sweating, abdominal pain and ascites (due to peritoneal involvement) are less common presentations. Mesothelioma is directly attributable to occupational asbestos exposure with a history of exposure in over 90% of cases. There is also evidence that mesothelioma may result from both para-occupational exposure and non-occupational ""environmental"" exposure. Idiopathic or spontaneous mesothelioma can also occur in the absence of any exposure to asbestos, with a spontaneous rate in humans of around one per million. A combination of accurate exposure history, along with examination radiology and pathology are essential to make the diagnosis. Distinguishing malignant from benign pleural disease can be challenging. The most helpful CT findings suggesting malignant pleural disease are 1) a circumferential pleural rind, 2) nodular pleural thickening, 3) pleural thickening of > 1 cm and 4) mediastinal pleural involvement. Involvement of a multidisciplinary team is recommended to ensure prompt and appropriate management, using a framework of radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery and symptom palliation with end of life care. Compensation issues must also be considered. Life expectancy in malignant mesothelioma is poor, with a median survival of about one year following diagnosis.",0
Mapping the sequence mutations of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus neuraminidase relative to drug and antibody binding sites,"In this work, we study the consequences of sequence variations of the ""2009 H1N1"" (swine or Mexican flu) influenza A virus strain neuraminidase for drug treatment and vaccination. We find that it is phylogenetically more closely related to European H1N1 swine flu and H5N1 avian flu rather than to the H1N1 counterparts in the Americas. Homology-based 3D structure modeling reveals that the novel mutations are preferentially located at the protein surface and do not interfere with the active site. The latter is the binding cavity for 3 currently used neuraminidase inhibitors: oseltamivir (Tamiflu(®)), zanamivir (Relenza(®)) and peramivir; thus, the drugs should remain effective for treatment. However, the antigenic regions of the neuraminidase relevant for vaccine development, serological typing and passive antibody treatment can differ from those of previous strains and already vary among patients. This article was reviewed by Sandor Pongor and L. Aravind.",0
"The Trojan Chicken Study, Minnesota",We conducted a study in the summer of 2004 at county fairs in the Midwest to investigate the role poultry exhibits have in spreading avian pathogens to humans. A nearly invisible powder (pathogen surrogate) that fluoresces under UV light was surreptitiously sprinkled each day on 1 show bird at each of 2 fairs. A UV light box was used to daily examine the hands of 94 poultry-exhibit participants (blinded regarding UV box results) for up to 4 days during the poultry shows. Enrollment and end-of-study questionnaires collected data on pathogen risk factors. Eight (8.5%) of 94 participants had evidence of fluorescent powder contamination (95% confidence interval 2.76%–14.26%). This contamination and infrequent handwashing practices suggest that county fairs are a possible venue for animal-to-human pathogen transmission.,0
Adherence and colonization by bacterial pathogens in explant cultures of bovine mammary tissue," 

This paper examines the adherence and colonization of bacterial pathogens in explant cultures of bovine mammary tissue. Explants are biopsies or small samples taken from animals that can be used to study a wide range of biological processes, specifically, milk production capabilities and potential associations with certain diseases. While the use of explants has been widely studied elsewhere, this study seeks to bring new insights into how bacteria may become attached or colonize the tissue through different stages and mechanisms. The results will have broad implications for both animal agriculture industry practices as well as better understanding pathogenic bacteria's behavior levels in mammals..",1
Progress in the development of pandemic influenza vaccines and their production technologies,"

'Progress in the development of pandemic influenza vaccines and their production technologies': In light of recent events, the need for novel methods for rapidly producing safe and effective pandemic influenza vaccine has become apparent. Following various breakthroughs in technological advances, there is a pressing need to investigate how these innovations can be utilized to maximize production efficiency whilst ensuring efficacy. This research paper focuses on the approach that current technological developments offer and evaluates their potential use in creatingPandemic Influenza Vaccines (PIV). Specifically, this paper will examine how advancements such as bio-manufacturing platforms, single dose delivery systemsand other related technologies can inform the process involved with developing PIVs at large scale with improved precision than before. By exploring progress made, this research aims to both provide an overview of existing solutions and encourage further training into alternative approaches capable of increasing speed and reliability within rapid vaccine manufacture when responding to emerging outbreaks or seasonal variants swiftly.",1
Sero-prevalences of selected cattle diseases in the Kafue flats of Zambia,"

The Kafue Flats in Zambia are home to a wide range of agricultural enterprises, including cattle production. This study aimed to quantify the prevalence of selected cattle diseases and evaluate any associated risk factors in this region. Data was collected from 221 herds over 18 months by an experienced team of veterinarians and epidemiologists through surveys, interviews and field observations. Serological ELISA tests were performed on sampled animals' sera for five common bovine diseases - African Horse Sickness (AHS), Corridor Disease (CD), Infectious Bovine Rhinotracheitis (IBR), Anthrax and Foot-and Mouth Disease (FMD). Rates of infection ranged from low to medium as no major outbreaks occurred during the survey period. However, significant associations were detected between age groups for IBR, CD and AHS infections and with breed type for FMD presence when compared against disease-free controls using appropriate odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals. The findings provide new insights into the prevalence dynamics of these crucial infectious agents prevalent among livestock herds located in the Kafue Flats farm environment.",1
Serological Profiling of a Candida albicans Protein Microarray Reveals Permanent Host-Pathogen Interplay and Stage-Specific Responses during Candidemia,"Candida albicans in the immunocompetent host is a benign member of the human microbiota. Though, when host physiology is disrupted, this commensal-host interaction can degenerate and lead to an opportunistic infection. Relatively little is known regarding the dynamics of C. albicans colonization and pathogenesis. We developed a C. albicans cell surface protein microarray to profile the immunoglobulin G response during commensal colonization and candidemia. The antibody response from the sera of patients with candidemia and our negative control groups indicate that the immunocompetent host exists in permanent host-pathogen interplay with commensal C. albicans. This report also identifies cell surface antigens that are specific to different phases (i.e. acute, early and mid convalescence) of candidemia. We identified a set of thirteen cell surface antigens capable of distinguishing acute candidemia from healthy individuals and uninfected hospital patients with commensal colonization. Interestingly, a large proportion of these cell surface antigens are involved in either oxidative stress or drug resistance. In addition, we identified 33 antigenic proteins that are enriched in convalescent sera of the candidemia patients. Intriguingly, we found within this subset an increase in antigens associated with heme-associated iron acquisition. These findings have important implications for the mechanisms of C. albicans colonization as well as the development of systemic infection.",0
Improved production of human type II procollagen in the yeast Pichia pastoris in shake flasks by a wireless-controlled fed-batch system,"BACKGROUND: Here we describe a new technical solution for optimization of Pichia pastoris shake flask cultures with the example of production of stable human type II collagen. Production of recombinant proteins in P. pastoris is usually performed by controlling gene expression with the strong AOX1 promoter, which is induced by addition of methanol. Optimization of processes using the AOX1 promoter in P. pastoris is generally done in bioreactors by fed-batch fermentation with a controlled continuous addition of methanol for avoiding methanol toxification and carbon/energy starvation. The development of feeding protocols and the study of AOX1-controlled recombinant protein production have been largely made in shake flasks, although shake flasks have very limited possibilities for measurement and control. RESULTS: By applying on-line pO(2 )monitoring we demonstrate that the widely used pulse feeding of methanol results in long phases of methanol exhaustion and consequently low expression of AOX1 controlled genes. Furthermore, we provide a solution to apply the fed-batch strategy in shake flasks. The presented solution applies a wireless feeding unit which can be flexibly positioned and allows the use of computer-controlled feeding profiles. By using the human collagen II as an example we show that a quasi-continuous feeding profile, being the simplest way of a fed-batch fermentation, results in a higher production level of human collagen II. Moreover, the product has a higher proteolytic stability compared to control cultures due to the increased expression of human collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylase as monitored by mRNA and protein levels. CONCLUSION: The recommended standard protocol for methanol addition in shake flasks using pulse feeding is non-optimal and leads to repeated long phases of methanol starvation. The problem can be solved by applying the fed-batch technology. The presented wireless feeding unit, together with an on-line monitoring system offers a flexible, simple, and low-cost solution for initial optimization of the production in shake flasks which can be performed in parallel. By this way the fed-batch strategy can be applied from the early screening steps also in laboratories which do not have access to high-cost and complicated bioreactor systems.",0
Isothermal Amplification Using a Chemical Heating Device for Point-of-Care Detection of HIV-1,"

This study explores the novel use of isothermal amplification methodologies in combination with a chemical heating device for point-of-care detection of HIV-1. With current challenges in existing diagnostic techniques and inadequate access to laboratory facilities, the demand for rapid antigen based testing has grown acutely in low resource settings. A simplified means of accurately detecting such viruses would prove invaluable to global public health efforts. To accomplish this goal, we propose evaluation of an improved protocol utilizing isothermal amplification coupled with a versatile form factor thermal cycler that exploits exothermic reactions as its source of heat energy — allowing inexpensive and portable utilization at Point-of-Care (PoC) level with versatility in sample types for further renewable energy independent deployment. Through comprehensive comparative analysis against RT/PCR methods, our findings will assess the efficacy and potential scalability within real world clinical implementation scenarios towards combating growing cases of HIV-1 infections worldwide.",1
In Vitro Gene Delivery Mediated by Asialofetuin-Appended Cationic Liposomes Associated with γ-Cyclodextrin into Hepatocytes,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate in vitro gene delivery mediated by asialofetuin-appended cationic liposomes (AF-liposomes) associating cyclodextrins (CyD/AF-liposomes) as a hepatocyte-selective nonviral vector. Of various CyDs, AF-liposomes associated with plasmid DNA (pDNA) and γ-cyclodextrin (γ-CyD) (pDNA/γ-CyD/AF-liposomes) showed the highest gene transfer activity in HepG2 cells without any significant cytotoxicity. In addition, γ-CyD enhanced the encapsulation ratio of pDNA with AF-liposomes, and also increased gene transfer activity as the entrapment ratio of pDNA into AF-liposomes was increased. γ-CyD stabilized the liposomal membrane of AF-liposomes and inhibited the release of calcein from AF-liposomes. The stabilizing effect of γ-CyD may be, at least in part, involved in the enhancing gene transfer activity of pDNA/γ-CyD/AF-liposomes. Therefore, these results suggest the potential use of γ-CyD for an enhancer of transfection efficiency of AF-liposomes.",0
How necessary is a fast testkit for mitigation of pandemic flu?,"It is widely feared that a novel, highly pathogenic, human transmissible influenza virus may evolve that could cause the next global pandemic. Mitigating the spread of such an influenza pandemic would require not only the timely administration of antiviral drugs to those infected, but also the implementation of suitable intervention policies for stunting the spread of the virus. Towards this end, mathematical modelling and simulation studies are crucial as they allow us to evaluate the predicted effectiveness of the various intervention policies before enforcing them. Diagnosis plays a vital role in the overall pandemic management framework by detecting and distinguishing the pathogenic strain from the less threatening seasonal strains and other influenza-like illnesses. This allows treatment and intervention to be deployed effectively, given limited antiviral supplies and other resources. However, the time required to design a fast and accurate testkit for novel strains may limit the role of diagnosis. Herein, we aim to investigate the cost and effectiveness of different diagnostic methods using a stochastic agent-based city-scale model, and then address the issue of whether conventional testing approaches, when used with appropriate intervention policies, can be as effective as fast testkits in containing a pandemic outbreak. We found that for mitigation purposes, fast and accurate testkits are not necessary as long as sufficient medication is given, and are generally recommended only when used with extensive contact tracing and prophylaxis. Additionally, in the event of insufficient medication and fast testkits, the use of slower, conventional testkits together with proper isolation policies while waiting for the diagnostic results can be an equally effective substitute.",0
Augmented Lung Inflammation Protects against Influenza A Pneumonia,"BACKGROUND: Influenza pneumonia causes high mortality every year, and pandemic episodes kill millions of people. Influenza-related mortality has been variously ascribed to an ineffective host response that fails to limit viral replication, an excessive host inflammatory response that results in lung injury and impairment of gas exchange, or to bacterial superinfection. We sought to determine whether lung inflammation promoted or impaired host survival in influenza pneumonia. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To distinguish among these possible causes of influenza-related death, we induced robust lung inflammation by exposing mice to an aerosolized bacterial lysate prior to challenge with live virus. The treatment induced expression of the inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid 8- and 40-fold greater, respectively, than that caused by lethal influenza infection. Yet, this augmented inflammation was associated with striking resistance to host mortality (0% vs 90% survival, p = 0.0001) and reduced viral titers (p = 0.004). Bacterial superinfection of virus infected lungs was not observed. When mice were repeatedly exposed to the bacterial lysate, as would be clinically desirable during an influenza epidemic, there was no tachyphylaxis of the induced viral resistance. When the bacterial lysate was administered after the viral challenge, there was still some mortality benefit, and when ribavirin was added to the aerosolized bacterial lysate, host survival was synergistically improved (0% vs 93.3% survival, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Together, these data indicate that innate immune resistance to influenza can be effectively stimulated, and suggest that ineffective rather than excessive inflammation is the major cause of mortality in influenza pneumonia.",0
Distinct immunoregulatory cytokine pattern in Egyptian patients with occult Hepatitis C infection and unexplained persistently elevated liver transaminases,"

The Mediterranean region is one of the most heavily affected areas by hepatitis C virus (HCV), and the prevalence rate has increased dramatically in recent years. This study sought to explore whether Egyptian patients with occult HCV infection and persistently elevated liver transaminases have distinct cytokine pattern profiles that could explain their condition. Through a prospective study, circulating cytokines were assessed from 66 individuals with unexplained chronically raised alanine aminotransferase levels and evidence of occult HCV infection on RT-PCR genotyping. Our findings indicate that a defined immunoregulatory profile comprised deepened T cell responses coupled with decreased expression of regulatory cytokines such as IL-27p28 may be associated with the development of this condition. These results indicate an immune dysregulation underlying the persistent elevation in serum ALT among these patients, contributing to improved comprehension of illnes progression and treatment options for those affected by this pervasive disease across Egypt.",1
Evaluation of the Seeplex® Meningitis ACE Detection Kit for the Detection of 12 Common Bacterial and Viral Pathogens of Acute Meningitis,"

This scientific study presents a comprehensive evaluation of the Seeplex® Meningitis ACE Detection Kit for the detection of twelve common bacterial and viral pathogens associated with acute meningitis. Acute meningitis is a life-threatening infections caused by bacteria or viruses that rapidly spreads across the central nervous system, resulting in widespread morbidity and mortality worldwide. In an attempt to combat this debilitating disease, quick and accurate diagnosis of various etiological agents is essential for effective management. However, there has been limited efficacy assessment of commercially available assays for the specific identification of known etiologic agents involved in acute meningitis prior to now. Therefore, we evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of Seeplex® Meningitis ACE Detection Kit using 90 clinical samples obtained from both pediatric and adult patients presenting with symptomatic acute meningitis as part of our broad retrospective observational trial at two tertiary care centers in Germany over a 3 year period (2013–2015). The performance characteristics yielded were found to be satisfactory with no significant differences observed between specimens collected from children compared with those obtained from adults indicating good reproducibility accross different patient groups tested. Consequently, our findings suggest that this kit could provide an easy yet reliable method to diagnose clinically relevant infectious causes both within clinical labs as well as on-site settings due to its User-friendly approach and fast results delivered in <2 hours post sample inoculation if desired making it ideal for use especially when dealing large cohorts requiring prompt test results before further action can be taken allowing clinicians timely decision making towards appropriate treatment measures which may potentially impact overall prognoses .",1
"Human Health, Well-Being, and Global Ecological Scenarios","

This article examines how global ecological scenarios affect human health and well-being, focusing on aspects of climate change, biodiversity loss, air pollution and water contamination. Recent years have seen an increase in evidence to suggest that humans are impacted in numerous ways by the environment they inhabit; both quality of life, long term sustainability and human health outcomes can all be shaped by these changes. Drawing upon relevant literature from within a range of disciplines - including environmental science and public health - this paper seeks to explore how changing global ecologies play out in terms of effects upon society's most vulnerable individuals who are much more likely to bear the brunt of any alterations. Ultimately it is argued that accumulation knowledge at this cross disciplinary level could aid initiatives towards greater stability for our future generations; helping to protect them from dangerous health risks associated with catastrophic species extinction events or extreme weather patterns.",1
Identification of new participants in the rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) oocyte maturation and ovulation processes using cDNA microarrays,"BACKGROUND: The hormonal control of oocyte maturation and ovulation as well as the molecular mechanisms of nuclear maturation have been thoroughly studied in fish. In contrast, the other molecular events occurring in the ovary during post-vitellogenesis have received far less attention. METHODS: Nylon microarrays displaying 9152 rainbow trout cDNAs were hybridized using RNA samples originating from ovarian tissue collected during late vitellogenesis, post-vitellogenesis and oocyte maturation. Differentially expressed genes were identified using a statistical analysis. A supervised clustering analysis was performed using only differentially expressed genes in order to identify gene clusters exhibiting similar expression profiles. In addition, specific genes were selected and their preovulatory ovarian expression was analyzed using real-time PCR. RESULTS: From the statistical analysis, 310 differentially expressed genes were identified. Among those genes, 90 were up-regulated at the time of oocyte maturation while 220 exhibited an opposite pattern. After clustering analysis, 90 clones belonging to 3 gene clusters exhibiting the most remarkable expression patterns were kept for further analysis. Using real-time PCR analysis, we observed a strong up-regulation of ion and water transport genes such as aquaporin 4 (aqp4) and pendrin (slc26). In addition, a dramatic up-regulation of vasotocin (avt) gene was observed. Furthermore, angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 (ace2), coagulation factor V (cf5), adam 22, and the chemokine cxcl14 genes exhibited a sharp up-regulation at the time of oocyte maturation. Finally, ovarian aromatase (cyp19a1) exhibited a dramatic down-regulation over the post-vitellogenic period while a down-regulation of Cytidine monophosphate-N-acetylneuraminic acid hydroxylase (cmah) was observed at the time of oocyte maturation. CONCLUSION: We showed the over or under expression of more that 300 genes, most of them being previously unstudied or unknown in the fish preovulatory ovary. Our data confirmed the down-regulation of estrogen synthesis genes during the preovulatory period. In addition, the strong up-regulation of aqp4 and slc26 genes prior to ovulation suggests their participation in the oocyte hydration process occurring at that time. Furthermore, among the most up-regulated clones, several genes such as cxcl14, ace2, adam22, cf5 have pro-inflammatory, vasodilatory, proteolytics and coagulatory functions. The identity and expression patterns of those genes support the theory comparing ovulation to an inflammatory-like reaction.",0
Anthropogenic factors and the risk of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1: prospects from a spatial-based model,"Beginning in 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus spread across Southeast Asia, causing unprecedented epidemics. Thailand was massively infected in 2004 and 2005 and continues today to experience sporadic outbreaks. While research findings suggest that the spread of HPAI H5N1 is influenced primarily by trade patterns, identifying the anthropogenic risk factors involved remains a challenge. In this study, we investigated which anthropogenic factors played a role in the risk of HPAI in Thailand using outbreak data from the “second wave” of the epidemic (3 July 2004 to 5 May 2005) in the country. We first performed a spatial analysis of the relative risk of HPAI H5N1 at the subdistrict level based on a hierarchical Bayesian model. We observed a strong spatial heterogeneity of the relative risk. We then tested a set of potential risk factors in a multivariable linear model. The results confirmed the role of free-grazing ducks and rice-cropping intensity but showed a weak association with fighting cock density. The results also revealed a set of anthropogenic factors significantly linked with the risk of HPAI. High risk was associated strongly with densely populated areas, short distances to a highway junction, and short distances to large cities. These findings highlight a new explanatory pattern for the risk of HPAI and indicate that, in addition to agro-environmental factors, anthropogenic factors play an important role in the spread of H5N1. To limit the spread of future outbreaks, efforts to control the movement of poultry products must be sustained.",0
FluGenome: a web tool for genotyping influenza A virus,"Influenza A viruses are hosted by numerous avian and mammalian species, which have shaped their evolution into distinct lineages worldwide. The viral genome consists of eight RNA segments that are frequently exchanged between different viruses via a process known as genetic reassortment. A complete genotype nomenclature is essential to describe gene segment reassortment. Specialized bioinformatic tools to analyze reassortment are not available, which hampers progress in understanding its role in host range, virulence and transmissibility of influenza viruses. To meet this need, we have developed a nomenclature to name influenza A genotypes and implemented a web server, FluGenome (http://www.flugenome.org/), for the assignment of lineages and genotypes. FluGenome provides functions for the user to interrogate the database in different modalities and get detailed reports on lineages and genotypes. These features make FluGenome unique in its ability to automatically detect genotype differences attributable to reassortment events in influenza A virus evolution.",0
Localization of Low-Density Detergent-Resistant Membrane Proteins in Intact and Acrosome-Reacted Mouse Sperm,"Mammalian sperm become fertile after completing capacitation, a process associated with cholesterol loss and changes in the biophysical properties of the sperm membranes that prepares the sperm to undergo the acrosome reaction. Different laboratories have hypothesized that cholesterol efflux can influence the extent and/or movement of lipid raft microdomains. In a previous study, our laboratory investigated the identity of sperm proteins putatively associated with rafts. After extraction with Triton X-100 and ultracentrifugation in sucrose gradients, proteins distributing to the light buoyant-density fractions were cored from polyacrylamide gels and microsequenced. In this study, a subset of these proteins (TEX101, basigin, hexokinase 1, facilitated glucose transporter 3, IZUMO, and SPAM1) and other molecules known to be enriched in membrane rafts (caveolin 2, flotillin 1, flotillin 2, and the ganglioside GM3) were selected to investigate their localization in the sperm and their behavior during capacitation and the acrosome reaction. These molecules localize to multiple sperm domains, including the acrosomal cap (IZUMO, caveolin 2, and flotillin 2), equatorial segment (GM3), cytoplasmic droplet (TEX101), midpiece (basigin, facilitated glucose transporter 3, and flotillin 2), and principal piece (facilitated glucose transporter 3). Some of these markers modified their immunofluorescence pattern after sperm incubation under capacitating conditions, and these changes correlated with the occurrence of the acrosome reaction. While GM3 and caveolin 2 were not detected after the acrosome reaction, flotillin 2 was found in the equatorial segment of acrosome-reacted sperm, and IZUMO distributed along the sperm head, reaching the post- and para-acrosomal areas. Taking into consideration the requirement of the acrosome reaction for sperm to become fusogenic, these results suggest that membrane raft dynamics may have a role in sperm-egg membrane interaction.",0
Inhibition of BmNPV replication in Bombyx mori cell by dsRNA triggered RNA interference,"

The title of this article is 'Inhibition of BmNPV Replication in Bombyx mori Cell by dsRNA Triggered RNA Interference'. In recent years, considerable progress has been made towards understanding the complex interactions between RNA interference (RNAi) and virus replication. However, details regarding inhibition of Baculovirus multi-nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) replication in the lepidopteran host, Bombyx mori cell, remain elusive. This paper aims to explore dsRNA mediated RNA interference for BmNPV suppression in B. Mori cell lines using a novel construct model artificially synthesized from recombinant DNA technology. Results from western blotting technique demonstrate that viral gene expression is significantly reduced upon transfection with dsRNA which led to a considerable reduction of progeny production and polyhedral inclusion body formation without toxic effects on normal cells viability indicating high applicability for pest management control strategies against devastating moth species such as B. quinquefasciatus or Helicoverpa armigera .",1
Efficient Assembly and Secretion of Recombinant Subviral Particles of the Four Dengue Serotypes Using Native prM and E Proteins,"BACKGROUND: Flavivirus infected cells produce infectious virions and subviral particles, both of which are formed by the assembly of prM and E envelope proteins and are believed to undergo the same maturation process. Dengue recombinant subviral particles have been produced in cell cultures with either modified or chimeric proteins but not using the native forms of prM and E. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have used a codon optimization strategy to obtain an efficient expression of native viral proteins and production of recombinant subviral particles (RSPs) for all four dengue virus (DV) serotypes. A stable HeLa cell line expressing DV1 prME was established (HeLa-prME) and RSPs were analyzed by immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscopy. We found that E protein is mainly present in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where assembly of RSPs could be observed. Biochemical characterization of DV1 RSPs secretion revealed both prM protein cleavage and homodimerization of E proteins before their release into the supernatant, indicating that RSPs undergo a similar maturation process as dengue virus. Pulse chase experiment showed that 8 hours are required for the secretion of DV1 RSPs. We have used HeLa-prME to develop a semi-quantitative assay and screened a human siRNA library targeting genes involved in membrane trafficking. Knockdown of 23 genes resulted in a significant reduction in DV RSP secretion, whereas for 22 others we observed an increase of RSP levels in cell supernatant. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data describe the efficient production of RSPs containing native prM and E envelope proteins for all dengue serotypes. Dengue RSPs and corresponding producing cell lines are safe and novel tools that can be used in the study of viral egress as well as in the development of vaccine and drugs against dengue virus.",0
Diagnosis and management of drug-associated interstitial lung disease,"Symptoms of drug-associated interstitial lung disease (ILD) are nonspecific and can be difficult to distinguish from a number of illnesses that commonly occur in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) on therapy. Identification of drug involvement and differentiation from other illnesses is problematic, although radiological manifestations and clinical tests enable many of the alternative causes of symptoms in advanced NSCLC to be excluded. In lung cancer patients, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) is more sensitive than a chest radiograph in evaluating the severity and progression of parenchymal lung disease. Indeed, the use of HRCT imaging has led to the recognition of many distinct patterns of lung involvement and, along with clinical signs and symptoms, helps to predict both outcome and response to treatment. This manuscript outlines the radiology of drug-associated ILD and its differential diagnosis in NSCLC. An algorithm that uses clinical tests to exclude alternative diagnoses is also described.",0

Timeliness of contact tracing among flight passengers for influenza A/H1N1 2009,"

The timeliness of contact tracing among flight passengers is an important consideration when attempting to control and contain the spread of influenza A/H1N1 2009. Public health practitioners have struggled with the challenge of rapidly locating potentially exposed individuals, requiring rapid deployment of contact investigation techniques such as passenger notification processes. The aim of this study is to assess the effectiveness in reaching contacts as well as identifying timetables for implementation under different scenarios at airports and during flights to mitigate transmission. A mathematical model based on data from a sample population will be developed using Markov chains to simulate strategies such as quarantining or vaccination and analyzing key parameters, including time until cases are isolated, contact quarantine start times and duration, rate of infection spreading and immunity levels over a period. Results will help inform resource allocation decisions upon re-emergence influenza A/H1N1 2009 outbreaks in future years by providing guidance on prioritization measures that effectively target high risk populations and limit virus spread in transport settings.",1
Functional analysis of the SRV-1 RNA frameshifting pseudoknot,"Simian retrovirus type-1 uses programmed ribosomal frameshifting to control expression of the Gag-Pol polyprotein from overlapping gag and pol open-reading frames. The frameshifting signal consists of a heptanucleotide slippery sequence and a downstream-located 12-base pair pseudoknot. The solution structure of this pseudoknot, previously solved by NMR [Michiels,P.J., Versleijen,A.A., Verlaan,P.W., Pleij,C.W., Hilbers,C.W. and Heus,H.A. (2001) Solution structure of the pseudoknot of SRV-1 RNA, involved in ribosomal frameshifting. J. Mol. Biol., 310, 1109–1123] has a classical H-type fold and forms an extended triple helix by interactions between loop 2 and the minor groove of stem 1 involving base–base and base–sugar contacts. A mutational analysis was performed to test the functional importance of the triple helix for −1 frameshifting in vitro. Changing bases in L2 or base pairs in S1 involved in a base triple resulted in a 2- to 5-fold decrease in frameshifting efficiency. Alterations in the length of L2 had adverse effects on frameshifting. The in vitro effects were well reproduced in vivo, although the effect of enlarging L2 was more dramatic in vivo. The putative role of refolding kinetics of frameshifter pseudoknots is discussed. Overall, the data emphasize the role of the triple helix in −1 frameshifting.",0
Chitinase Dependent Control of Protozoan Cyst Burden in the Brain,"

This article investigates the mechanisms of chitinase-dependent control over protozoan cyst burden in the brain. Developed by microbiologists from Trier University, Germany, a novel approach was applied to determine the contribution of Aotusalemella similis-derived chitinases on controlling infection in model organisms. Using a Dictyostelium discoideum strain harbouring an inducible expression system for Aschit2P3, an endogenous brush border membrane chitinase from A. similis infective larvae, our results suggest that this enzyme is essential for suppressing production and growth of procyclic form Trypanosoma brucei per strain. This research constitutes ground-breaking progress towards achieving more efficient strategies against neurological trypanosomiasis caused by parasites akin to T. Brucei as we uncover insights into parasitic regulation via proteolytic activities and could open new avenues towards specific intervention approaches targeting host response at both gene expression and protein level with potential therapeutic implications on brain disorder etiology highlights our findings describing novel regulatory pathways which suggests even further use potentials due to its enzymatic flexibility offering excellent promises of highly specific treatment options in outbreaks where current methods have proven ineffective over time or insufficiently effective due to resistance development within parasite populations .",1
Two Birds with One Stone? Possible Dual-Targeting H1N1 Inhibitors from Traditional Chinese Medicine,"

This study investigates the possibility of using traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) to develop dual-target inhibitors as an effective therapy for H1N1 infection. Considering that influenza virus replicates rapidly, it is important to seek treatment strategies that simultaneously prevent viral replication and restore perturbed host immune responses. In this research, we investigate the efficacy of TCM-derived compounds in inhibiting two critical targets at once—the hemagglutinin glycoprotein and the NF-κB pathway; both known as vital elements involved in H1N1 binding, internalization, entry into cells and replication. We report our findings from molecular docking studies where medications derived from TCM show good affinities for specific protein targets tested during a proof of concept experiments on animals with H1N1 infection. Our results suggest that certain TCM compounds can be used to inhibit the content of activated interferon response genes related to the type I interferon antiviral program while concurrently reducing expression levels of key hemagglutinin proteins. Altogether, these results prove encouraging toward innovation options available through repurposing existing drugs without harming or impacting other peripheral systems involved in healthy metabolism states. 
The overall purpose is thus clear: demonstrate possibility for combinatory therapeutics comprising herbal derivatives synergistic elicitation resulting in drug syndication effects against Influenza A (H1N1).

"Pandemic influenza A virus codon usage revisited: biases, adaptation and implications for vaccine strain development","

This article examines the prevalence of codon usage bias in pandemic influenza A virus and its implications for vaccine strain development. Pandemic influenza viruses pose a significant public health threat to humans due to their ability not only to cause severe morbidity and mortality upon occurrence, but also to spread quickly throughout global populations as they mutate rapidly over time. As part of this process, they often exhibit an imbalance in codon usage compared with other organisms. We have used sequence analysis techniques and studies on empirical trends in species-level gene expression data sets to review the pattern of selection pressure acting on pandemic influenza A virus under various conditions, uncovering different biases at play along with both natural and engineered adaptations by investigating recent epidemics as well as laboratory strains closely related to field isolates. Further investigations into antiviral drug sensitivity revealed that active sites were enriched for rare codons indicative of strong selective pressures within these regions known activation sites potentially involved in antibody recognition during vaccination campaigns. Our findings provide new avenues for exploring how changes favor certain host sequences, suggesting potential directions for actively utilizing them when developing novel vaccine strategies against emerging pandemics now or having preparedness responses ready ahead of any future outbreaks scenarios.",1
Willingness of Hong Kong healthcare workers to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination at different WHO alert levels: two questionnaire surveys,"Objective To assess the acceptability of pre-pandemic influenza vaccination among healthcare workers in public hospitals in Hong Kong and the effect of escalation in the World Health Organization’s alert level for an influenza pandemic. Design Repeated cross sectional studies using self administered, anonymous questionnaires Setting Surveys at 31 hospital departments of internal medicine, paediatrics, and emergency medicine under the Hong Kong Hospital Authority from January to March 2009 and in May 2009 Participants 2255 healthcare workers completed the questionnaires in the two studies. They were doctors, nurses, or allied health professionals working in the public hospital system. Main outcome measures Stated willingness to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination (influenza A subtypes H5N1 or H1N1) and its associating factors. Results The overall willingness to accept pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine was only 28.4% in the first survey, conducted at WHO influenza pandemic alert phase 3. No significant changes in the level of willingness to accept pre-pandemic H5N1 vaccine were observed despite the escalation to alert phase 5. The willingness to accept pre-pandemic H1N1 vaccine was 47.9% among healthcare workers when the WHO alert level was at phase 5. The most common reasons for an intention to accept were “wish to be protected” and “following health authority’s advice.” The major barriers identified were fear of side effects and doubts about efficacy. More than half of the respondents thought nurses should be the first priority group to receive the vaccines. The strongest positive associating factors were history of seasonal influenza vaccination and perceived risk of contracting the infection. Conclusions The willingness to accept pre-pandemic influenza vaccination was low, and no significant effect was observed with the change in WHO alert level. Further studies are required to elucidate the root cause of the low intention to accept pre-pandemic vaccination.",0
Interference of H-bonding and substituent effects in nitro- and hydroxy-substituted salicylaldehydes,"

This article studies the effects of hydrogen bonding and substituents on nitro- and hydroxy-substituted salicylaldehydes. Using various computational tools, densities for each of these molecules have been explored. The results suggest that there is a significant influence of H-bonding as well as different electron donating groups on the structure and reactivity when comparing substituted salicylaldehydes with an unsubstituted version. These findings can help to develop new strategies in drug design aimed at improving their efficacy both in terms of speed and selectivity. Therefore, this article strives to investigate the interference of H-bonding and substituent effects in nitroand hydroxy-substituted salicylaldehydes that could play a key role in optimization processes involved with uncovering novel Medicinal Chemistry approaches.",1
A Gene Encoding Sialic-Acid-Specific 9-O-Acetylesterase Found in Human Adult Testis,"Using differential display RT-PCR, we identified a gene of 2750 bp from human adult testis, named H-Lse, which encoded a putative protein of 523 amino acids and molecular weight of 58 kd with structural characteristics similar to that of mouse lysosome sialic-acid-specific 9-O-acetylesterase. Northern blot analysis showed a widespread distribution of H-Lse in various human tissues with high expression in the testis, prostate, and colon. In situ hybridization results showed that while H-Lse was not detected in embryonic testis, positive signals were found in spermatocytes but not spermatogonia in adult testis of human. The subcellular localization of H-Lse was visualized by green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the amino terminus of H-Lse, showing compartmentalization of H-Lse in large dense-core vesicles, presumably lysosomes, in the cytoplasm. The developmentally regulated and spermatogenic stage-specific expression of H-Lse suggests its possible involvement in the development of the testis and/or differentiation of germ cells.",0
Australian public health policy in 2003 – 2004,"In Australia, compared with other developed countries the many and varied programs which comprise public health have continued to be funded poorly and unsystematically, particularly given the amount of publicly voiced political support. In 2003, the major public health policy developments in communicable disease control were in the fields of SARS, and vaccine funding, whilst the TGA was focused on the Pan Pharmaceutical crisis. Programs directed to health maintenance and healthy ageing were approved. The tertiary education sector was involved in the development of programs for training the public health workforce and new professional qualifications and competencies. The Abelson Report received support from overseas experts, providing a potential platform for calls to improve national funding for future Australian preventive programs; however, inconsistencies continued across all jurisdictions in their approaches to tackling national health priorities. Despite 2004 being an election year, public health policy was not visible, with the bulk of the public health funding available in the 2004/05 federal budget allocated to managing such emerging risks as avian flu. We conclude by suggesting several implications for the future.",0
Transmission of Infectious Diseases En Route to Habitat Hotspots,"

This study examines the transmission of infectious diseases amongst animals as they transfer of a variety of species to various ‘habitat hotspots’. The investigation focuses on identifying which animals have the greatest risk and vulnerability, underlining the importance that disease management strategies play in order to prevent the spread between species. Pathogens such as coccidia, Bordetella bronchiseptica and myxomatosits viruses are being studied in particular due to their broad impact on biodiversity levels and general domination within sites housing different wildlife ecosystems. Extensive research has been carried out across various habitat hotspots ranging from forests, rivers and deserts, using molecular epidemiological data alongside proven monitoring techniques for pathology sampling by way of faecal swabs or captures. Results will be compared against climate change scenarios with potential increases or decreases in temperature contributing towards the route taken by infected organisms aiming to reach these unique hubs for periods at a time. This paper aims to outline any extreme risks posed when it comes to preventing vector borne zoonosis linked directly via migratory pathways used annually among terrestrial birds and furred mammals while congregating through industrialised locations prompting further recognition into this topic area especially since habitat specialization is increasingly threatened due to land fragmentation along those particular routes leading onto permanent changes environmentally throughout each region detailed here today.",1
Conservation of polyamine regulation by translational frameshifting from yeast to mammals,"Regulation of ornithine decarboxylase in vertebrates involves a negative feedback mechanism requiring the protein antizyme. Here we show that a similar mechanism exists in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The expression of mammalian antizyme genes requires a specific +1 translational frameshift. The efficiency of the frameshift event reflects cellular polyamine levels creating the autoregulatory feedback loop. As shown here, the yeast antizyme gene and several newly identified antizyme genes from different nematodes also require a ribosomal frameshift event for their expression. Twelve nucleotides around the frameshift site are identical between S.pombe and the mammalian counterparts. The core element for this frameshifting is likely to have been present in the last common ancestor of yeast, nematodes and mammals.",0
Enhancing Time-Series Detection Algorithms for Automated Biosurveillance,"BioSense is a US national system that uses data from health information systems for automated disease surveillance. We studied 4 time-series algorithm modifications designed to improve sensitivity for detecting artificially added data. To test these modified algorithms, we used reports of daily syndrome visits from 308 Department of Defense (DoD) facilities and 340 hospital emergency departments (EDs). At a constant alert rate of 1%, sensitivity was improved for both datasets by using a minimum standard deviation (SD) of 1.0, a 14–28 day baseline duration for calculating mean and SD, and an adjustment for total clinic visits as a surrogate denominator. Stratifying baseline days into weekdays versus weekends to account for day-of-week effects increased sensitivity for the DoD data but not for the ED data. These enhanced methods may increase sensitivity without increasing the alert rate and may improve the ability to detect outbreaks by using automated surveillance system data.",0
Particulate matter air pollution disrupts endothelial cell barrier via calpain-mediated tight junction protein degradation,"

Air pollution is a major source of environmental stress to which our bodies are exposed, and has been associated with multiple adverse health effects. This study aims to investigate the effect of particulate matter (PM) air pollution on endothelial cell barrier via calpain-mediated tight junction protein degradation. The results revealed that exposure to PM can cause disruption of the cell's inflammatory response and membrane integrity, as evidenced by changes in the expression levels of several key proteins involved in maintaining endothelial permeability such as ZO-1. It was also demonstrated that extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inhibition prevented these structural alterations suggesting a potential target for therapeutic interventions against air pollutants-induced vascular diseases in humans.",1
Pattern Recognition Receptor–Dependent Mechanisms of Acute Lung Injury,"Acute lung injury (ALI) that clinically manifests as acute respiratory distress syndrome is caused by an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response resulting from clinical events including sepsis, major surgery and trauma. Innate immunity activation plays a central role in the development of ALI. Innate immunity is activated through families of related pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which recognize conserved microbial motifs or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors were the first major family of PRRs discovered in mammals. Recently, NACHT–leucine-rich repeat (LRR) receptors and retinoic acid–inducible gene–like receptors have been added to the list. It is now understood that in addition to recognizing infectious stimuli, both Toll-like receptors and NACHT-LRR receptors can also respond to endogenous molecules released in response to stress, trauma and cell damage. These molecules have been termed damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). It has been clinically observed for a long time that infectious and noninfectious insults initiate inflammation, so confirmation of overlapping receptor-signal pathways of activation between PAMPs and DAMPs is no surprise. This review provides an overview of the PRR-dependent mechanisms of ALI and clinical implication. Modification of PRR pathways is likely to be a logical therapeutic target for ALI/acute respiratory distress syndrome.",0
Ventilator associated pneumonia and infection control,"Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units. The incidence of VAP varies from 7% to 70% in different studies and the mortality rates are 20–75% according to the study population. Aspiration of colonized pathogenic microorganisms on the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract is the main route for the development of VAP. On the other hand, the major risk factor for VAP is intubation and the duration of mechanical ventilation. Diagnosis remains difficult, and studies showed the importance of early initiation of appropriate antibiotic for prognosis. VAP causes extra length of stay in hospital and intensive care units and increases hospital cost. Consequently, infection control policies are more rational and will save money.",0
Respiratory failure presenting in H1N1 influenza with Legionnaires disease: two case reports,"

This article presents two case reports of respiratory failure resulting from concomitant infection by H1N1 influenza and Legionnaires disease, a rare but life-threatening combination. Two adult patients required hospitalization due to acute symptoms related to these infections. In both cases, diagnosis was based on positive laboratory results supporting concurrent presence of the two infectious agents in their respiratory systems. Detailed medical histories revealed the risk factors underlying this morbid condition with its severe complications. Management strategies were implemented for each patient which included therapeutic treatment with antibiotics and intensive supportive care. The course of progression for both cases showed marked improvement following hospitalization, allowing safe discharge and continuation of outpatient follow-up protocol supervised by specialist physicians experienced in managing such complex clinical scenarios caused by multiple organisms concurrently present in an individual's airways. Despite prompt determinate treatment, this dual infection put these patients at serious risk for significant morbidity; therefore vigilance is warranted when dealing with similar clinical presentations regardless of causative agent combinations seen during public health emergences,.",1
The Complete Genome and Proteome of Laribacter hongkongensis Reveal Potential Mechanisms for Adaptations to Different Temperatures and Habitats,"Laribacter hongkongensis is a newly discovered Gram-negative bacillus of the Neisseriaceae family associated with freshwater fish–borne gastroenteritis and traveler's diarrhea. The complete genome sequence of L. hongkongensis HLHK9, recovered from an immunocompetent patient with severe gastroenteritis, consists of a 3,169-kb chromosome with G+C content of 62.35%. Genome analysis reveals different mechanisms potentially important for its adaptation to diverse habitats of human and freshwater fish intestines and freshwater environments. The gene contents support its phenotypic properties and suggest that amino acids and fatty acids can be used as carbon sources. The extensive variety of transporters, including multidrug efflux and heavy metal transporters as well as genes involved in chemotaxis, may enable L. hongkongensis to survive in different environmental niches. Genes encoding urease, bile salts efflux pump, adhesin, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and other putative virulence factors—such as hemolysins, RTX toxins, patatin-like proteins, phospholipase A1, and collagenases—are present. Proteomes of L. hongkongensis HLHK9 cultured at 37°C (human body temperature) and 20°C (freshwater habitat temperature) showed differential gene expression, including two homologous copies of argB, argB-20, and argB-37, which encode two isoenzymes of N-acetyl-L-glutamate kinase (NAGK)—NAGK-20 and NAGK-37—in the arginine biosynthesis pathway. NAGK-20 showed higher expression at 20°C, whereas NAGK-37 showed higher expression at 37°C. NAGK-20 also had a lower optimal temperature for enzymatic activities and was inhibited by arginine probably as negative-feedback control. Similar duplicated copies of argB are also observed in bacteria from hot springs such as Thermus thermophilus, Deinococcus geothermalis, Deinococcus radiodurans, and Roseiflexus castenholzii, suggesting that similar mechanisms for temperature adaptation may be employed by other bacteria. Genome and proteome analysis of L. hongkongensis revealed novel mechanisms for adaptations to survival at different temperatures and habitats.",0
Low usage of government healthcare facilities for acute respiratory infections in guatemala: implications for influenza surveillance,"

The threat of influenza outbreaks in Guatemala is significantly undermined by limited access to government healthcare facilities for acute respiratory infections (ARI). Low usage and the consequent inability to track outbreaks are major impediments to effective surveillance. This paper examines the patterns of ARI healthcare service utilisation among populations living close to six cities in Guatemala, and insightfully determines any implications on influenza surveillance therein. Utilising a quantitive methodology that relied on survey data from 2,567 participants across 11 health centres, this study found that only 32% of patients suffering from ARI accessed government healthcare services during the period investigated. The findings further revealed significant discrepancies among demographic groups in terms of utilisation rate, with higher rates seen amongst those older than 70 years old (43%), followed by females aged 30-49 (35%). Socio-economic status and urban/rural residence were also factors influencing ARI allocation decisions – individuals with no schooling or primary schools education levels had lower probabilities for their consultation needs being met compared to secondary school graduates or above. Further policy refinement is recommended as such observed disparities suggest unfavourable circumstances limiting good public health practices; more importantly, proper Flu Surveillance entails adequate identification of patient cases and retrospective analysis so as to effectively manage current pandemic threats.",1
Targets and Intracellular Signaling Mechanisms for Deoxynivalenol-Induced Ribosomal RNA Cleavage,"

This paper examines the intracellular signaling mechanisms behind Deoxynivalenol-induced ribosomal RNA cleavage, and identifies potential targets for countermeasures. Recent advances in molecular biology have elucidated crucial aspects of the way that deoxynivalenol—a common mycotoxin produced by Fusarium species—stimulates intracellular RNA degradation pathways. Despite this knowledge, few investigations have attempted to decipher exactly how deoxynivalenol activates these pathways and which proteins could be targeted for the development of more specific therapeutics against exposure to environmental mycotoxins. This article reviews recent investigations into the field and proposes targets for future research endeavors in order to shed light on this important area of cell biology.",1

The results suggest that the prompt response from public health officials was instrumental in limiting the impact of the epidemic.",1
"Pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus infection and TNF, LTA, IL1B, IL6, IL8, and CCL polymorphisms in Mexican population: a case–control study","

This study assesses the influence of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 virus infection and TNF, LTA, IL1B, IL6, IL8 and CCL polymorphisms as well as their contribution to disease severity in a Mexican population. We conducted a case-control study comparing subjects with severe influenza infection to those who had an uncomplicated course of the illness that involved 437 individuals between 2009-2010 at general hospitals in Mexico City Metropolitan area. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -; accompanied by DNA restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis or sequence analysis for candidate genes TNF α (-308 G/A), LTA (+252ΔG/A), Interleukin 1β (-511C/T and +3953C/T), Interleukin 6 (–174G>C) Interleukin 8 (−251A>T) and CCL5 −28C>G. Our results showed statistically significant associations between A/H1N1 virus infection severity cases versus controls and the following single nucleotide polymorphisms: TNF alpha–308 GA genotype p = 0.02; OR = 1.68 [95 % CI = 1.09 – 2 .59] ;LTA+252ΔGA genotype p= 0 .002; OR=2 .48 95 %CI= main findings were that four regulatory TLR4 gene variants are known determinants for risk of influenza A complication;namely tnfα G(−308)/AA,lta :: GA /AY , il­ 1b :: CT / ­CT

Pandemic influenza preparedness: an ethical framework to guide decision-making,"BACKGROUND: Planning for the next pandemic influenza outbreak is underway in hospitals across the world. The global SARS experience has taught us that ethical frameworks to guide decision-making may help to reduce collateral damage and increase trust and solidarity within and between health care organisations. Good pandemic planning requires reflection on values because science alone cannot tell us how to prepare for a public health crisis. DISCUSSION: In this paper, we present an ethical framework for pandemic influenza planning. The ethical framework was developed with expertise from clinical, organisational and public health ethics and validated through a stakeholder engagement process. The ethical framework includes both substantive and procedural elements for ethical pandemic influenza planning. The incorporation of ethics into pandemic planning can be helped by senior hospital administrators sponsoring its use, by having stakeholders vet the framework, and by designing or identifying decision review processes. We discuss the merits and limits of an applied ethical framework for hospital decision-making, as well as the robustness of the framework. SUMMARY: The need for reflection on the ethical issues raised by the spectre of a pandemic influenza outbreak is great. Our efforts to address the normative aspects of pandemic planning in hospitals have generated interest from other hospitals and from the governmental sector. The framework will require re-evaluation and refinement and we hope that this paper will generate feedback on how to make it even more robust.",0
"Agricultural intensification, priming for persistence and the emergence of Nipah virus: a lethal bat-borne zoonosis","

This paper presents an evaluation of the potential for increased intensity in agricultural practices to increase pressure from bat-borne zoonoses, with a particular focus on Nipah virus (NiV) infection. India has a sizable population of flying foxes that could facilitate cross-species transmission and host cycling of NiV. Contemporary changes in agricultural intensification increase contact and stressors on wild animals, particularly fruit bats, which are capable carriers of deadly zoonotic diseases such as NiV; this reveals heightened risks for emergence of related human illnesses. Using contextual data drawing upon observational studies encompassing epidemiological trends, behavioural observations, socioeconomical surveillance strategies and historical cases regarding outbreaks due to NiV exposure alongside technical resources utilizing high resolution radiational imaging techniques indicate a complex relationship between scenarios where intensive agricultural implementation was observed long before disease discovery or emergent infections were assumed connected to activities previously labelled 'normal' farming dynamics. This investigation thereby seeks to inform emphasis on comparative analysis when managing transitions towards land use principles characterized by large scales in order to contain risk associated with environmental insults posed by infectious agents endemic reservoirs that may involve other hosts such as humans in their transmission cycles.",1
Electrospray ionisation-cleavable tandem nucleic acid mass tag–peptide nucleic acid conjugates: synthesis and applications to quantitative genomic analysis using electrospray ionisation-MS/MS,"The synthesis and characterization of isotopomer tandem nucleic acid mass tag–peptide nucleic acid (TNT–PNA) conjugates is described along with their use as electrospray ionisation-cleavable (ESI-Cleavable) hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of target DNA sequences by electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS/MS). ESI-cleavable peptide TNT isotopomers were introduced into PNA oligonucleotide sequences in a total synthesis approach. These conjugates were evaluated as hybridization probes for the detection and quantification of immobilized synthetic target DNAs using ESI-MS/MS. In these experiments, the PNA portion of the conjugate acts as a hybridization probe, whereas the peptide TNT is released in a collision-based process during the ionization of the probe conjugate in the electrospray ion source. The cleaved TNT acts as a uniquely resolvable marker to identify and quantify a unique target DNA sequence. The method should be applicable to a wide variety of assays requiring highly multiplexed, quantitative DNA/RNA analysis, including gene expression monitoring, genetic profiling and the detection of pathogens.",0
"Targeting vaccination against novel infections: risk, age and spatial structure for pandemic influenza in Great Britain","The emergence of a novel strain of H1N1 influenza virus in Mexico in 2009, and its subsequent worldwide spread, has focused attention to the question of optimal deployment of mass vaccination campaigns. Here, we use three relatively simple models to address three issues of primary concern in the targeting of any vaccine. The advantages of such simple models are that the underlying assumptions and effects of individual parameters are relatively clear, and the impact of uncertainty in the parametrization can be readily assessed in the early stages of an outbreak. In particular, we examine whether targeting risk-groups, age-groups or spatial regions could be optimal in terms of reducing the predicted number of cases or severe effects; and how these targeted strategies vary as the epidemic progresses. We examine the conditions under which it is optimal to initially target vaccination towards those individuals within the population who are most at risk of severe effects of infection. Using age-structured mixing matrices, we show that targeting vaccination towards the more epidemiologically important age groups (5–14 year olds and then 15–24 year olds) leads to the greatest reduction in the epidemic growth and hence reduces the total number of cases. Finally, we consider how spatially targeting the vaccine towards regions of country worst affected could provide an advantage. We discuss how all three of these priorities change as both the speed at which vaccination can be deployed and the start of the vaccination programme is varied.",0
The crazy-paving pattern: a radiological-pathological correlation,"

This study examines the correlation between the distinctive radiological and pathological features of a rare lung disease referred to as the 'Crazy-paving Pattern'.

Molecular Imaging Reveals a Progressive Pulmonary Inflammation in Lower Airways in Ferrets Infected with 2009 H1N1 Pandemic Influenza Virus,"

This study presents the analysis of molecular imaging as a revealing tool to identify progressive pulmonary inflammation in lower airways in ferrets infected with 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus. Using noninvasive imaging modalities, lung abnormality was monitored over a period of 21 days post-infection. The findings indicated that the inflammation affected the larger bronchi and distal alveolar tissue. Immunohistochemical staining revealed elevated levels of interleukin 6 and 8, indicating an active inflammatory response due to viral replication within alveolar macrophages. In summary, our results showed that molecular imaging is valuable for visualizing early changes associated with subclinical disease progression caused by pandemic influenza viruses.",1
Comparison of distance measures in spatial analytical modeling for health service planning,"BACKGROUND: Several methodological approaches have been used to estimate distance in health service research. In this study, focusing on cardiac catheterization services, Euclidean, Manhattan, and the less widely known Minkowski distance metrics are used to estimate distances from patient residence to hospital. Distance metrics typically produce less accurate estimates than actual measurements, but each metric provides a single model of travel over a given network. Therefore, distance metrics, unlike actual measurements, can be directly used in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance is most often used, but unlikely the most appropriate metric. Minkowski distance is a more promising method. Distances estimated with each metric are contrasted with road distance and travel time measurements, and an optimized Minkowski distance is implemented in spatial analytical modeling. METHODS: Road distance and travel time are calculated from the postal code of residence of each patient undergoing cardiac catheterization to the pertinent hospital. The Minkowski metric is optimized, to approximate travel time and road distance, respectively. Distance estimates and distance measurements are then compared using descriptive statistics and visual mapping methods. The optimized Minkowski metric is implemented, via the spatial weight matrix, in a spatial regression model identifying socio-economic factors significantly associated with cardiac catheterization. RESULTS: The Minkowski coefficient that best approximates road distance is 1.54; 1.31 best approximates travel time. The latter is also a good predictor of road distance, thus providing the best single model of travel from patient's residence to hospital. The Euclidean metric and the optimal Minkowski metric are alternatively implemented in the regression model, and the results compared. The Minkowski method produces more reliable results than the traditional Euclidean metric. CONCLUSION: Road distance and travel time measurements are the most accurate estimates, but cannot be directly implemented in spatial analytical modeling. Euclidean distance tends to underestimate road distance and travel time; Manhattan distance tends to overestimate both. The optimized Minkowski distance partially overcomes their shortcomings; it provides a single model of travel over the network. The method is flexible, suitable for analytical modeling, and more accurate than the traditional metrics; its use ultimately increases the reliability of spatial analytical models.",0
"Human pregnancy-associated malaria-specific B cells target polymorphic, conformational epitopes in VAR2CSA","Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is caused by Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes (IEs) that bind to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) in the placenta by PAM-associated clonally variant surface antigens (VSA). Pregnancy-specific VSA (VSA(PAM)), which include the PfEMP1 variant VAR2CSA, are targets of IgG-mediated protective immunity to PAM. Here, we report an investigation of the specificity of naturally acquired immunity to PAM, using eight human monoclonal IgG1 antibodies that react exclusively with intact CSA-adhering IEs expressing VSA(PAM). Four reacted in Western blotting with high-molecular-weight (> 200 kDa) proteins, while seven reacted with either the DBL3-X or the DBL5-ε domains of VAR2CSA expressed either as Baculovirus constructs or on the surface of transfected Jurkat cells. We used a panel of recombinant antigens representing DBL3-X domains from P. falciparum field isolates to evaluate B-cell epitope diversity among parasite isolates, and identified the binding site of one monoclonal antibody using a chimeric DBL3-X construct. Our findings show that there is a high-frequency memory response to VSA(PAM), indicating that VAR2CSA is a primary target of naturally acquired PAM-specific protective immunity, and demonstrate the value of human monoclonal antibodies and conformationally intact recombinant antigens in VSA characterization.",0
Clinical features and risk factors for severe and critical pregnant women with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza infection in China,"

This study titled 'Clinical features and risk factors for severe and critical pregnant women with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza infection in China' highlights the clinical manifestations, severity, mortality rate and risk factors of maternal-fetal outcomes among pregnant women diagnosed with pandemic H1N1 influenza during the Second Wave of Influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 in China. With an increasing number of pregnant women infected by this strain, it is important to provide evidence on why they are at high-risk and vulnerable to more serious complications if left untreated. To address this knowledge gap 945 patients were recruited from two tertiary care hospitals between 2015 - 2019 including 447 severe cases and 498 non-severe cases where 430 (51%) had gestational age greater than 28 weeks. Utilizing descriptive statistics, bivariate comparisons along with multiple logistic regression analysis associated long-term sequelae was assessed in relation to primary exposure or preexisting medical conditions verus gestational age or other demographic characteristics such as nationality . Results demonstrated that delivery earlier compared to those between 37 - 40 weeks gestation further significantly increased their risk for severe disease outcome. This study conducted the largest assessment thus far examining the incidence rate of fatal infections resulting from pandemic HINI among expecting mothers located throughout major regions within China indicating a clear need for timely diagnosis treatment guidelines amongst female groups especially those starting high risk pregnancies before disease onset as well as preventive strategies tailored towards these individuals.",1
Evaluation of potential reference genes in real-time RT-PCR studies of Atlantic salmon,"BACKGROUND: Salmonid fishes are among the most widely studied model fish species but reports on systematic evaluation of reference genes in qRT-PCR studies is lacking. RESULTS: The stability of six potential reference genes was examined in eight tissues of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), to determine the most suitable genes to be used in quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses. The relative transcription levels of genes encoding 18S rRNA, S20 ribosomal protein, β-actin, glyceraldehyde-3P-dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and two paralog genes encoding elongation factor 1A (EF1A(A )and EF1A(B)) were quantified in gills, liver, head kidney, spleen, thymus, brain, muscle, and posterior intestine in six untreated adult fish, in addition to a group of individuals that went through smoltification. Based on calculations performed with the geNorm VBA applet, which determines the most stable genes from a set of tested genes in a given cDNA sample, the ranking of the examined genes in adult Atlantic salmon was EF1A(B)>EF1A(A)>β-actin>18S rRNA>S20>GAPDH. When the same calculations were done on a total of 24 individuals from four stages in the smoltification process (presmolt, smolt, smoltified seawater and desmoltified freshwater), the gene ranking was EF1A(B)>EF1A(A)>S20>β-actin>18S rRNA>GAPDH. CONCLUSION: Overall, this work suggests that the EF1A(A )and EF1A(B )genes can be useful as reference genes in qRT-PCR examination of gene expression in the Atlantic salmon.",0
Perspectives on Immunoglobulins in Colostrum and Milk,"

This paper discusses perspectives on immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk, two aquatic invertebrates which are essential for optimal human health. Immunoglobulin contained within these liquids play an integral role in the protection of humans against infectious diseases, allergies, metabolic disorders and other maladies. Accordingly, research into their composition and structure has become increasingly important to understand how change may affect immune responses. The present article summarizes current knowledge about immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk by exploring their composition, function, sources and biological diversity - as well as examining potential changes that can occur when exposed to different stimuli or environmental conditions. Furthermore, insight is given into future directions for research which could enhance our understanding of these macromolecules' role in human health maintenance. Ultimately it is concluded that further investigation will be pivotal to expand the awareness of this field's importance; aiding both scientists and clinicians looking to better serve clients/patients with improved therapies or treatments through a deeper appreciation of immunoglobulin-associated ailments.",1
Definition of Mafa-A and -B haplotypes in pedigreed cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis),"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I B gene/allelic repertoire was investigated in a pedigreed population of cynomolgus macaques of mixed Indonesian/Malaysian origin. The Mafa-B alleles detected in this cohort are mostly specific for a given geographic area, and only a small number of alleles appears to be shared with other populations. This suggests the fast evolution of Mafa-B alleles due to adaptation to new environments. In contrast to humans, the B locus in Old World monkeys displays extensive copy number variation. The Mafa-B and previously defined -A gene combinations segregate in families and thus allowed the definition of extended haplotypes. In many cases it was possible to assign a particular Mafa-I allele to one of these Mafa-A/B haplotypes as well. The presence of a large number of stable haplotypes in this cohort of animals, which was pedigreed for up to eight generations, looks promising for developing discriminative MHC typing tools that are less cumbersome. Furthermore, the discovery of 53 unreported Mafa-B sequences expands the lexicon of alleles significantly, and may help in understanding the complex organisation of the macaque B region.",0
Recent Advances in the Diagnosis and Treatment of Influenza Pneumonia,"

This paper examines recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of influenza pneumonia, a condition with potentially life-threatening implications for people who contract it. In particular, this article looks at enhanced screening protocols for early detection; increased use of antiviral agents to reduce transmission rates after exposure; and improved vaccination strategies as viable interventions against milder cases. To further inform readers, the latest clinical evidence relating to pharmacological management is included along with international guidelines for medical practitioners worldwide. By providing an insight into modern approaches to combating this significant issue, it hopes that both healthcare workers can draw valuable knowledge from its analysis.",1
Endogenous Cell Repair of Chronic Demyelination,"In multiple sclerosis lesions, remyelination typically fails with repeated or chronic demyelinating episodes and results in neurologic disability. Acute demyelination models in rodents typically exhibit robust spontaneous remyelination that prevents appropriate evaluation of strategies for improving conditions of insufficient remyelination. In the current study, we used a mouse model of chronic demyelination induced by continuous ingestion of 0.2% cuprizone for 12 weeks. This chronic process depleted the oligodendrocyte progenitor population and impaired oligodendrocyte regeneration. Remyelination remained limited after removal of cuprizone from the diet. Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) expression was persistently increased in the corpus callosum of chronically demyelinated mice as compared with nonlesioned mice. We used FGF2(−/−)mice to determine whether removal of endogenous FGF2 promoted remyelination of chronically demyelinated areas. Wild-type and FGF2(−/−)mice exhibited similar demyelination during chronic cuprizone treatment. Importantly, in contrast to wild-type mice, the FGF2(−/−)mice spontaneously remyelinated completely during the recovery period after chronic demyelination. Increased remyelination in FGF2(−/−)mice correlated with enhanced oligodendroglial regeneration. FGF2 genotype did not alter the density of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells or proliferating cells after chronic demyelination. These findings indicate that attenuating FGF2 created a sufficiently permissive lesion environment for endogenous cells to effectively remyelinate viable axons even after chronic demyelination.",0
Ducks: The “Trojan Horses” of H5N1 influenza,"Abstract Wild ducks are the main reservoir of influenza A viruses that can be transmitted to domestic poultry and mammals, including humans. Of the 16 hemagglutinin (HA) subtypes of influenza A viruses, only the H5 and H7 subtypes cause highly pathogenic (HP) influenza in the natural hosts. Several duck species are naturally resistant to HP Asian H5N1 influenza viruses. These duck species can shed and spread virus from both the respiratory and intestinal tracts while showing few or no disease signs. While the HP Asian H5N1 viruses are 100% lethal for chickens and other gallinaceous poultry, the absence of disease signs in some duck species has led to the concept that ducks are the “Trojan horses” of H5N1 in their surreptitious spread of virus. An important unresolved issue is whether the HP H5N1 viruses are maintained in the wild duck population of the world. Here, we review the ecology and pathobiology of ducks infected with influenza A viruses and ducks’ role in the maintenance and spread of HP H5N1 viruses. We also identify the key questions about the role of ducks that must be resolved in order to understand the emergence and control of pandemic influenza. It is generally accepted that wild duck species can spread HP H5N1 viruses, but there is insufficient evidence to show that ducks maintain these viruses and transfer them from one generation to the next.",0
Automated identification of multiple micro-organisms from resequencing DNA microarrays,"There is an increasing recognition that detailed nucleic acid sequence information will be useful and even required in the diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of many significant pathogens. Because generating detailed information about pathogens leads to significantly larger amounts of data, it is necessary to develop automated analysis methods to reduce analysis time and to standardize identification criteria. This is especially important for multiple pathogen assays designed to reduce assay time and costs. In this paper, we present a successful algorithm for detecting pathogens and reporting the maximum level of detail possible using multi-pathogen resequencing microarrays. The algorithm filters the sequence of base calls from the microarray and finds entries in genetic databases that most closely match. Taxonomic databases are then used to relate these entries to each other so that the microorganism can be identified. Although developed using a resequencing microarray, the approach is applicable to any assay method that produces base call sequence information. The success and continued development of this approach means that a non-expert can now perform unassisted analysis of the results obtained from partial sequence data.",0
ViralORFeome: an integrated database to generate a versatile collection of viral ORFs,"Large collections of protein-encoding open reading frames (ORFs) established in a versatile recombination-based cloning system have been instrumental to study protein functions in high-throughput assays. Such ‘ORFeome’ resources have been developed for several organisms but in virology, plasmid collections covering a significant fraction of the virosphere are still needed. In this perspective, we present ViralORFeome 1.0 (http://www.viralorfeome.com), an open-access database and management system that provides an integrated set of bioinformatic tools to clone viral ORFs in the Gateway® system. ViralORFeome provides a convenient interface to navigate through virus genome sequences, to design ORF-specific cloning primers, to validate the sequence of generated constructs and to browse established collections of virus ORFs. Most importantly, ViralORFeome has been designed to manage all possible variants or mutants of a given ORF so that the cloning procedure can be applied to any emerging virus strain. A subset of plasmid constructs generated with ViralORFeome platform has been tested with success for heterologous protein expression in different expression systems at proteome scale. ViralORFeome should provide our community with a framework to establish a large collection of virus ORF clones, an instrumental resource to determine functions, activities and binding partners of viral proteins.",0
Quantifying social distancing arising from pandemic influenza,"

This research paper examines the quantitative effects of pandemic influenza on social distancing practices by surveying a representative population in a major metropolitan area. Utilizing detailed demographic data and quantitative metrics, this study measures both perceived changes in social distancing before, during, and after the peak of disease transmission; as well as long-term behavior change stemming from initial contagion.
  
The findings demonstrate that while there is a significant decrease in overall contact rates immediately following an infectious outbreak, these rates may quickly rebound to pre-outbreak levels once major threats are no longer present. Furthermore, it suggests that certain demographics exhibit more prolonged or permanent adjustments to their behaviors based upon infection risk factors. This study provides empirical evidence to support trends observed with other health crises and highlights potential avenues for policy considerations when public health concerns arise.",1

"The Acute Environment, Rather than T Cell Subset Pre-Commitment, Regulates Expression of the Human T Cell Cytokine Amphiregulin","

This article describes the findings of a study which set out to determine the influence of acute environment, rather than pre-commitment T cell subset, on expression levels of human T cell cytokine Amphiregulin in order to better understand its impact and relevance. For this purpose, adults who were newly diagnosed with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) were recruited for analyses of thymocyte development and long-term repopulating potential. Results revealed that environmental signals modulated Ampliregulin expression in both naive and memory subsets independent from precursors or native tissue microenvironments. Additionally, component cross talk enabled sustained attenuation between subpopulations via continuous modulation without involvement of immune receptor signaling pathways. These findings indicate that moderating factors within an acutely stressed environment are likely essential for maintenance or activation of specific molecules related to phenotype commitment during early stages of thymopoiesis possibly through dynamics reverberations among continuum components in healthy individuals as well as SCID patients.",1
Association of Fcγ Receptor IIB Polymorphism with Cryptococcal Meningitis in HIV-Uninfected Chinese Patients,"

This article investigates the potential association of Fcγ Receptor (FcɣR) IIB polymorphisms with Cryptococcal meningitis in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-uninfected Chinese patients. The pathological complexities of Cryptococcal meningitis and its high mortality rates, particularly in HIV-affected populations, have aroused extensive medical attention. Despite a number of recent studies exploring various genetic components related to susceptibility to this mysterious disease, the correlation between specific immune genes and deep phenotypic effect remains unclear. In our study, we investigated FcɣRIIB as a possible factor associated with infection risk among Chinese population by examining the prevalence rates immunologically and clinically in order to shed more light on the pathogenesis of cryptococcal meningitis. 237 non-HIV Chinese patients were genotyped for common functional single nucleotide polymorphism variants and analyzed against clinical records including diagnostic imaging results from participating hospitals. We believe that uncovering new biomarkers through this novel approach may enable physicians to better understand early stage infectivity risks as well as prevent or treat them under hence increasing prognostic success rate among hospitalized patients.",1
Two novel HLA-A*0201 T-cell epitopes in avian H5N1 viral nucleoprotein induced specific immune responses in HHD mice,"The influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) is an attractive target for avian flu vaccine development because of its high conversancy in the evolutionary chain of the virus. Here we identified two novel HLA-A*0201 restricted NP epitopes, named H5N1 NP373-381 AMDSNTLEL (NP373) and NP458-466 FQGRGVFEL (NP458), using computational bioinformatic analysis. The NP peptides showed a high binding affinity to HLA-A*0201 on T2 cells, and were able to induce the activation of the cytotoxic T cells in the human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. We examined the potential of using NP373 and NP458 peptide sequences supplemented with a single-chain trimer as potential DNA vaccine candidates in an HHD transgenic mouse model. A gene gun delivery system was used for administrating the vaccine candidates into the animals. The results from cytotoxicity and ELISPOT assays indicated that a significant amount of IFN-γ was secreted by the T cells of the vaccinated mice, and the T cells were able to eliminate the corresponding peptide-loaded T2 cells. The discovery of these novel immunogenic NP peptides provides valuable information for avian flu vaccine design and construction.",0
Radiological and Clinical Characteristics of a Military Outbreak of Pandemic H1N1 2009 Influenza Virus Infection,"OBJECTIVE: To describe detailed clinical and radiological features of the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viral infection among healthy young males in a semi-closed institutionalized setting. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 18 patients confirmed with the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection from July 18 to July 30, 2009 were enrolled in this study. Each patient underwent an evaluation to determine detailed clinical and radiological features. RESULTS: All patients presented with high fever (> 38.0℃), with accompanying symptoms of cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhea, and increased C-reactive protein (CRP) values with no leukocytosis nor elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). All patients, including one patient who progressed into acute respiratory distress syndrome, were treated with oseltamivir phosphate and quickly recovered from their symptoms. Chest radiographs showed abnormalities of small nodules and lobar consolidation in only two out of 18 patients. However, six of 12 patients who underwent thin-section CT examinations showed abnormal findings for small ground-glass opacities (GGOs) in addition to poorly-defined nodules with upper lobe predominance. CONCLUSION: In a population of healthy young adults, elevated CRP with normal ESR and white blood cell levels combined with GGOs and nodules on thin-section CT scans may indicate early signs of infection by the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus.",0
Liposome-Coupled Antigens Are Internalized by Antigen-Presenting Cells via Pinocytosis and Cross-Presented to CD8(+) T Cells,"We have previously demonstrated that antigens chemically coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids were cross-presented by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to CD8(+) T cells, and that this process resulted in the induction of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. In the present study, the mechanism by which the liposome-coupled antigens were cross-presented to CD8(+) T cells by APCs was investigated. Confocal laser scanning microscopic analysis demonstrated that antigens coupled to the surface of unsaturated-fatty-acid-based liposomes received processing at both MHC class I and class II compartments, while most of the antigens coupled to the surface of saturated-fatty-acid-based liposomes received processing at the class II compartment. In addition, flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that antigens coupled to the surface of unsaturated-fatty-acid-liposomes were taken up by APCs even in a 4°C environment; this was not true of saturated-fatty-acid-liposomes. When two kinds of inhibitors, dimethylamiloride (DMA) and cytochalasin B, which inhibit pinocytosis and phagocytosis by APCs, respectively, were added to the culture of APCs prior to the antigen pulse, DMA but not cytochalasin B significantly reduced uptake of liposome-coupled antigens. Further analysis of intracellular trafficking of liposomal antigens using confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that a portion of liposome-coupled antigens taken up by APCs were delivered to the lysosome compartment. In agreement with the reduction of antigen uptake by APCs, antigen presentation by APCs was significantly inhibited by DMA, and resulted in the reduction of IFN-γ production by antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells. These results suggest that antigens coupled to the surface of liposomes consisting of unsaturated fatty acids might be pinocytosed by APCs, loaded onto the class I MHC processing pathway, and presented to CD8(+) T cells. Thus, these liposome-coupled antigens are expected to be applicable for the development of vaccines that induce cellular immunity.",0
Improved Immunological Tolerance Following Combination Therapy with CTLA-4/Ig and AAV-Mediated PD-L1/2 Muscle Gene Transfer,"


This paper for the scientific journal reviews an innovative combination therapy as a promising new approach to improved immunological tolerance in autoimmune diseases. The novel method utilizes CTLA-4/Ig and AAV-mediated PD-L1/2 muscle gene transfer, wherein cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4)/immunoglobulin G is administered via systemic infusion and adeno associated virus mediated preproenkephalin expression after local intramuscular injection of plasmid DNA  to serve as a potential therapeutic treatment alternative to other common approaches such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs.

On the significance of Surfactant Protein-A within the human lungs,"Surfactant Protein-A (SP-A) is the most prominent among four proteins in the pulmonary surfactant-system. SP-A is expressed by alveolar epithelial cells type II as well as by a portion of non small cell lung carcinomas (NSCLC). The expression of SP-A is complexly regulated on the transcriptional and the chromosomal level. SP-A is a major player in the pulmonary cytokine-network and moreover has been described to act in the pulmonary host defense. By the use of cell culture or animal models the functional properties have been repeatedly shown in many aspects, often bearing surprising properties which strongly indicate the physiological importance of SP-A. To date SP-A is recognized as a molecule essential for pulmonary development, structure and function. An upcoming number of reports deals with the role of SP-A for pulmonary pathology. This article gives an overview about the state of knowledge on SP-A focused in applications for human pulmonary disorders and points out the importance for pathology-orientated research approaches using immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization as promising methods to further elucidate the role of this molecule in adult lung diseases.",0
Functional Studies of ssDNA Binding Ability of MarR Family Protein TcaR from Staphylococcus epidermidis,"

This study presents a comprehensive functional analysis of the ssDNA binding ability of TcaR, a MarR family protein from Staphylococcus epidermidis. In recent years, an increasing number of studies have been carried out to investigate the roles that MarRs play in bacterial gene expression and phenotypic adaptation by regulating diverse metabolic pathways. Among them, S. epidermidis with mar genes encoding homologs of the transcriptional regulator MarR has become one of the most widely studied bacteria due to its pathogenicity and continuous emergence as an opportunistic human pathogen. Herein, this work examines TcaR bioactivity employing biochemical assays for dimerization propensity and ssDNA affinity. Then several mutational experiments are performed on both central α-helices involved in DNA binding domain by site-directed mutagenesis followed by fluorescence spectroscopy titration experiments to elucidate charge environmental influence on Kd values obtained via ITC measurements under different salt conditions. Findings demonstrate that mutations conferring acidification within pocket 2 had relatively small effects on apparent dimerization free energy but significantly reduced DNA binding affinity for both phosphate group edges at lower monovalent ion concentrations which is further validated biophysically based findings obtained through high resolution structures solved by X-ray crystallography technique reflecting tight contact between substituents incorporated residues at two helices fusing pockets 1&2 region proximal domains and single stranded recognition helix 3 located far apart near connecting loop forming ssDNA bridge partially permeable to cationic ions translocation restricting flow thus providing allosteric regulation cues employed in transcriptional control modulators intelligence workflows executing stress response enabled epigenetic alterations leading towards drug tolerant states impacting exercise target cells population homeostasis resulting efficient immune evasion tactics arranged indirectly by scrounging gene modification resulting altered phenotype able selectively colonize host system relying engineering predicted outcomes observed during biomolecular observation protocols aided results foreseen implied performance levels identified through cellular inference taken task requirements planning responses dynamically decided avoiding risks generated collision countermeasures stated briefly problems resolved roughly curating functioning assembling static components together putting motion handled passage time mode allowing gradual evolutionary transformation accuracy trends convey mean task completion however inhibiting related parties maintaining organized state reaching equilibrium energy currently searching solution closely calibrated prospective interactions external environment observing changes closely formulated statistical data assembled simulation running process predicting future development stages configured manipulate seek reach expected outcome understanding molecular strategies revealed establishing functional complexity interconnected network register complex behavior hidden features varying scenarios taken side analyze underlying mechanisms refine models address relevant challenges faced current research depicting role overlapping layering conservationist minded approaches goes long way maximally evolve future predictability answering questions remain unanswered present very promising innovative approach ensure reliability integrated heterogenic environments fostering constructive collaboration sharing common goals pursued purpose enhancing knowledge conducive imagination trigger novel ideas advances field apprehend continues directions theoretical framework closing insights greater intervention integrating capabilities effect reliable enrichment global scale magnitude extent possibly bottom line observations gained provides vital included sufficient articulated motivated arguments theories proposed supports action plans procedure ready deployment",1
Severe novel influenza A (H1N1) infection in cancer patients,"Background: The natural history and consequences of severe H1N1 influenza infection among cancer patients are not yet fully characterized. We describe eight cases of H1N1 infection in cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit of a referral cancer center. Patients and methods: Clinical data from all patients admitted with acute respiratory failure due to novel viral H1N1 infection were reviewed. Lung tissue was submitted for viral and bacteriological analyses by real-time RT-PCR, and autopsy was conducted on all patients who died. Results: Eight patients were admitted, with ages ranging from 55 to 65 years old. There were five patients with solid organ tumors (62.5%) and three with hematological malignancies (37.5%). Five patients required mechanical ventilation and all died. Four patients had bacterial bronchopneumonia. All deaths occurred due to multiple organ failure. A milder form of lung disease was present in the three cases who survived. Lung tissue analysis was performed in all patients and showed diffuse alveolar damage in most patients. Other lung findings were necrotizing bronchiolitis or extensive hemorrhage. Conclusions: H1N1 viral infection in patients with cancer can cause severe illness, resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome and death. More data are needed to identify predictors of unfavorable evolution in these patients.",0
"High Influenza A Virus Infection Rates in Mallards Bred for Hunting in the Camargue, South of France","

High Influenza A Virus Infection Rates in Mallards Bred for Hunting in the Camargue, South of France
Migratory waterbirds have been observed to play a major role as reservoirs and disseminators of avian influenza viruses (AIVs) throughout the world. However, it remains unclear whether different environmental factors influence the dynamics of AIV flow between host species. The aim of this study was to investigate mallards bred for hunting in the Camargue area of Southern France, using virus isolation techniques, PCR assays and bioinformatic tools to evaluate infection rates and genetic diversity among isolated viruses. Our results indicate that AIV infections are both frequent and genetically diverse among mallard populations in this geographic location due to their being localized near wetlands that congregate large concentrations of wild water birds sharing food sources or contact points with each other. Taken together these data suggest that an emphasis on educational campaigns targeted at hunters focusing on limiting potential transmission routes between hosts is essential for successful management strategies when dealing with high levels flu prevalence among migratory bird populations like those found within this region

Transmission Parameters of the 2001 Foot and Mouth Epidemic in Great Britain,"Despite intensive ongoing research, key aspects of the spatial-temporal evolution of the 2001 foot and mouth disease (FMD) epidemic in Great Britain (GB) remain unexplained. Here we develop a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method for estimating epidemiological parameters of the 2001 outbreak for a range of simple transmission models. We make the simplifying assumption that infectious farms were completely observed in 2001, equivalent to assuming that farms that were proactively culled but not diagnosed with FMD were not infectious, even if some were infected. We estimate how transmission parameters varied through time, highlighting the impact of the control measures on the progression of the epidemic. We demonstrate statistically significant evidence for assortative contact patterns between animals of the same species. Predictive risk maps of the transmission potential in different geographic areas of GB are presented for the fitted models.",0
The gene of an archaeal α-l-fucosidase is expressed by translational frameshifting,"The standard rules of genetic translational decoding are altered in specific genes by different events that are globally termed recoding. In Archaea recoding has been unequivocally determined so far only for termination codon readthrough events. We study here the mechanism of expression of a gene encoding for a α-l-fucosidase from the archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (fucA1), which is split in two open reading frames separated by a −1 frameshifting. The expression in Escherichia coli of the wild-type split gene led to the production by frameshifting of full-length polypeptides with an efficiency of 5%. Mutations in the regulatory site where the shift takes place demonstrate that the expression in vivo occurs in a programmed way. Further, we identify a full-length product of fucA1 in S.solfataricus extracts, which translate this gene in vitro by following programmed −1 frameshifting. This is the first experimental demonstration that this kind of recoding is present in Archaea.",0

Inhibition of Interferon Induction and Action by the Nairovirus NSDV/GV
Interferons (IFNs) are vital in regulating cellular responses to pathogens thereby ensuring protection against infection. The inhibitory effect of nairoviruses, including Nairobi sheep disease virus (NSDV)/Ganjam virus (GV), on IFN induction and action remains poorly understood. This research analyses the effects these viruses have on host cell IFN-mediated responses. Utilising recombinant attenuated derivatives of sheep-derived NSDV/GV infected cells were induced for type I, II and III interferon receptors signalling which was then analysed using assays specific for each receptor ligand stimulation or total protein expression levels corresponding to a given receptor, Activation assays determining cellular innate antiviral transmission conferred by STAT1, as well as cytokine profiling in response to stimulated supernatants generated from a range of viruses tested remain consistent within this study. Evaluation determined that associations between inhibited induction & function could be attributed non viral genome material likely with an associative involvement in either targeting intrinsic pathways responsible for interferon regulation or promoting resident viral factors sufficient enough confer inhibition upon antigens inducing ISGs.

Mathematical Models of Memory CD8(+) T-Cell Repertoire Dynamics in Response to Viral Infections,"

This paper presents an overview of a comprehensive mathematical framework for understanding the dynamics of memory CD8(+) T-cells in response to viral infections. The authors employ algebraic and differential equations to study T-cell repertoires, which allow for various initial conditions, environmental parameters and even stochasticity. To this end, they constructed a variety of models with different complexities. Furthermore, they implemented numerical methods to solve the underlying simulations that allowed them to qualitatively understand how infection influences virus-specific CD8(+) T cell subsets over time. This research establishes how their proposed mathematical models can advance our knowledge on the pathogenesis and evolution of infectious diseases as well as facilitate real-time evaluation of immune responses at cellular level during vaccine development process or personalized interventions in clinical trials.  Our work is expected to bridge immunological theory gaps concerning repertoire dynamics under changing environments or other factors associated with infections while also giving insight into possible directions concerning pharmacokinetic modelling applications in personalized medicine field settings.",1
Evolutionary and Transmission Dynamics of Reassortant H5N1 Influenza Virus in Indonesia,"H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) viruses have seriously affected the Asian poultry industry since their recurrence in 2003. The viruses pose a threat of emergence of a global pandemic influenza through point mutation or reassortment leading to a strain that can effectively transmit among humans. In this study, we present phylogenetic evidences for the interlineage reassortment among H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated from humans, cats, and birds in Indonesia, and identify the potential genetic parents of the reassorted genome segments. Parsimony analyses of viral phylogeography suggest that the reassortant viruses may have originated from greater Jakarta and surroundings, and subsequently spread to other regions in the West Java province. In addition, Bayesian methods were used to elucidate the genetic diversity dynamics of the reassortant strain and one of its genetic parents, which revealed a more rapid initial growth of genetic diversity in the reassortant viruses relative to their genetic parent. These results demonstrate that interlineage exchange of genetic information may play a pivotal role in determining viral genetic diversity in a focal population. Moreover, our study also revealed significantly stronger diversifying selection on the M1 and PB2 genes in the lineages preceding and subsequent to the emergence of the reassortant viruses, respectively. We discuss how the corresponding mutations might drive the adaptation and onward transmission of the newly formed reassortant viruses.",0
"Possible linkages between lignite aquifers, pathogenic microbes, and renal pelvic cancer in northwestern Louisiana, USA","

This paper examines a potential connection between lignite aquifers, pathogenic microbes, and the incidence of renal pelvic cancer in northwestern Louisiana. The study was conducted to investigate whether there is any correlation between these factors within this particular region. To achieve this objective, groundwater samples were collected from 23 sites within the area to analyze for microbial populations that might serve as indicators for environmental contamination. Data obtained from medical and oncology records also provided information about localized cancer diagnosis rates over time. Statistical analysis included assessing correlations between mean water quality indexes and cancer risk profiles in Northwestern Louisiana communities, enabling an assessment of the possible linkages among lignite aquifers, pathogenic microbes, and kidney-urethra malignant tumors found within this geographical context. A key conclusion is that while additional studies are needed to show causation rather than merely correlation with more powerful statistical methods utilizing larger instances, preliminary findings suggest a need to expand public awareness campaigns regarding water pollution risks due varying nitrate levels detected in many local wells in addition further evaluation by health departments keeping track of regional tumor prevalence trends could be beneficial as well",1

Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS): review of common infectious manifestations and treatment options,"The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) in HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) results from restored immunity to specific infectious or non-infectious antigens. A paradoxical clinical worsening of a known condition or the appearance of a new condition after initiating therapy characterizes the syndrome. Potential mechanisms for the syndrome include a partial recovery of the immune system or exuberant host immunological responses to antigenic stimuli. The overall incidence of IRIS is unknown, but is dependent on the population studied and its underlying opportunistic infectious burden. The infectious pathogens most frequently implicated in the syndrome are mycobacteria, varicella zoster, herpesviruses, and cytomegalovirus (CMV). No single treatment option exists and depends on the underlying infectious agent and its clinical presentation. Prospective cohort studies addressing the optimal screening and treatment of opportunistic infections in patients eligible for ART are currently being conducted. These studies will provide evidence for the development of treatment guidelines in order to reduce the burden of IRIS. We review the available literature on the pathogenesis and epidemiology of IRIS, and present treatment options for the more common infectious manifestations of this diverse syndrome and for manifestations associated with a high morbidity.",0
Willingness to accept H1N1 pandemic influenza vaccine: A cross-sectional study of Hong Kong community nurses,"BACKGROUND: The 2009 pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) infection has alerted many governments to make preparedness plan to control the spread of influenza A (H1N1) infection. Vaccination for influenza is one of the most important primary preventative measures to reduce the disease burden. Our study aims to assess the willingness of nurses who work for the community nursing service (CNS) in Hong Kong on their acceptance of influenza A (H1N1) influenza vaccination. METHODS: 401 questionnaires were posted from June 24, 2009 to June 30, 2009 to community nurses with 67% response rate. Results of the 267 respondents on their willingness to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccine were analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-seven percent of respondents were willing to accept influenza vaccination if vaccines were available. Having been vaccinated for seasonable influenza in the previous 12 months were significantly independently associated with their willingness to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccination (OR = 4.03; 95% CI: 2.03-7.98). CONCLUSIONS: Similar to previous findings conducted in hospital healthcare workers and nurses, we confirmed that the willingness of community nurses to accept influenza A (H1N1) vaccination is low. Future studies that evaluate interventions to address nurses' specific concerns or interventions that aim to raise the awareness among nurses on the importance of influenza A (H1N1) vaccination to protect vulnerable patient populations is needed.",0
Factors influencing psychological distress during a disease epidemic: Data from Australia's first outbreak of equine influenza,"BACKGROUND: In 2007 Australia experienced its first outbreak of highly infectious equine influenza. Government disease control measures were put in place to control, contain, and eradicate the disease; these measures included movement restrictions and quarantining of properties. This study was conducted to assess the psycho-social impacts of this disease, and this paper reports the prevalence of, and factors influencing, psychological distress during this outbreak. METHODS: Data were collected using an online survey, with a link directed to the affected population via a number of industry groups. Psychological distress, as determined by the Kessler 10 Psychological Distress Scale, was the main outcome measure. RESULTS: In total, 2760 people participated in this study. Extremely high levels of non-specific psychological distress were reported by respondents in this study, with 34% reporting high psychological distress (K10 > 22), compared to levels of around 12% in the Australian general population. Analysis, using backward stepwise binary logistic regression analysis, revealed that those living in high risk infection (red) zones (OR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.57–2.55; p < 0.001) and disease buffer (amber) zones (OR = 1.83; 95% CI: 1.36–2.46; p < 0.001) were at much greater risk of high psychological distress than those living in uninfected (white zones). Although prevalence of high psychological distress was greater in infected EI zones and States, elevated levels of psychological distress were experienced in horse-owners nationally. Statistical analysis indicated that certain groups were more vulnerable to high psychological distress; specifically younger people, and those with lower levels of formal educational qualifications. Respondents whose principal source of income was from horse-related industry were more than twice as likely to have high psychological distress than those whose primary source of income was not linked to horse-related industry (OR = 2.23; 95% CI: 1.82–2.73; p < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Although, methodologically, this study had good internal validity, it has limited generalisability because it was not possible to identify, bound, or sample the target population accurately. However, this study is the first to collect psychological distress data from an affected population during such a disease outbreak and has potential to inform those involved in assessing the potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases, such as pandemic influenza.",0
A Delay Differential Model for Pandemic Influenza with Antiviral Treatment,"

This paper introduces a Delay Differential Model (DDM) for pandemic influenza with antiviral treatment. Influenza is a highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the Influenza virus, which is responsible for more than thousands of deaths every year. Considering its potential severity, it has become important to study preventive measures such as antiviral treatment through mathematical modelling techniques. The DDM proposed in this article incorporates delay terms and age structure that capture these aspects in an efficient way, making possible the identification of optimal strategies for preventative infection control measures against influenza epidemics including flu strain reassortment risks. In addition, we propose an application example of our model to assess connections between parameters related to different stages on infected cases and quantify effectiveness among alternative combination therapies with one or two drugs from different classes of anti-influenza treatments at multiple dosing levels are also considered.",1
Clinical Review: Gene-based therapies for ALI/ARDS: where are we now?,"

This clinical review aims to bring forth the current knowledge on gene-based therapeutic approaches for acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS). Through novel genetic editing tools, gene editing has become an efficient tool for treating ALI/ARDS diseases and other inherited disorders with promising results. As a result of decades of research into this field, various innovative strategies have been developed that involve gene therapy or regulation through small molecules. This paper will discuss some examples of successful gene-editing agents which may lead to breakthroughs in curing these life-threatening conditions. Recent scientific studies suggest that genomic engineering is an incredibly powerful means of managing ARDS by directly targeting mutant genes associated with pathogenic pathways leading to disease. Therefore, this paper will assess recent developments in medicine and provide a comprehensive overview of options currently available as well as highlight potential future directions in the treatment space. Together, this review provides evidence linking genomics technology towards creating effective therapies for ARDS patients and that could potentially improve their outcomes without significant side effects or toxicity risk factors associated with certain courses of drugs taken orally or intravenously today.",1

The extracts of Allium oreoprasum, Androsace strigilosa, Asparagus filicinus, Astilbe rivularis, Bergenia ciliata and Verbascum thapsus exhibited strong anti-influenza viral activity. Only the extracts of A. rivularis and B. ciliata demonstrated remarkable activity against both viruses.",0
"Virulent Avian Infectious Bronchitis Virus, People’s Republic of China","

This article describes the epidemiology, diagnosis and control of the recently identified virulent avian infectious bronchitis virus (AIBV) in the People’s Republic of China (PRC). In recent years, AIBV outbreaks have been reported in many provinces throughout the PRC. AIBV spreads rapidly among poultry and can quickly cause high mortality. Specific clinical signs include swollen-head syndrome, severe respiratory distress, trampling reaction and edema formation in infected birds. Avian infectious bronchitis is one of the most widespread viral diseases affecting chickens worldwide. Furthermore, this virus is highly contagious through close contact with infective agents expelled by an infected bird or via contaminated objects such as feeders or water containers. The ability to acquire resistance against AIBV infection has important implications for animal health management programs across Asia and should be addressed urgently to limit economic losses associated with this disease.",1
A comparison of methods for purification and concentration of norovirus GII-4 capsid virus-like particles,"Noroviruses (NoVs) are one of the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis worldwide. NoV GII-4 VP1 protein was expressed in a recombinant baculovirus system using Sf9 insect cells. Several methods for purification and concentration of virus-like particles (VLPs) were evaluated. Electron microscopy (EM) and histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) binding assays showed that repeated sucrose gradient purification followed by ultrafiltration resulted in intact VLPs with excellent binding to H type 3 antigens. VLPs were stable for at least 12 months at 4°C, and up to 7 days at ambient temperature. These findings indicate that this method yielded stable and high-quality VLPs.",0
"2,500-year Evolution of the Term Epidemic","

This article examines the evolution of the word epidemic over a span of 2,500 years from its Greek origin in Homer’s Iliad. Drawing on etymology, linguistics, and history this research intends to map out how the term has been used to describe epidemics across different regions throughout time. By describing changes in nomenclature within both medical and general vocabulary over this period, we will reveal why it is necessary for language use to adjust with changing circumstances. Furthermore, implications that arise regarding our current understanding of pandemics are strengthened by an overview of modern linguistic applications of 'epidemic'. Finally, conclusions drawn from this study attempt to inform doctors and policy-makers alike by contextualizing their language choices appropriately when conversing about public health threats.",1
Empirical Relationship between Intra-Purine and Intra-Pyrimidine Differences in Conserved Gene Sequences,"DNA sequences seen in the normal character-based representation appear to have a formidable mixing of the four nucleotides without any apparent order. Nucleotide frequencies and distributions in the sequences have been studied extensively, since the simple rule given by Chargaff almost a century ago that equates the total number of purines to the pyrimidines in a duplex DNA sequence. While it is difficult to trace any relationship between the bases from studies in the character representation of a DNA sequence, graphical representations may provide a clue. These novel representations of DNA sequences have been useful in providing an overview of base distribution and composition of the sequences and providing insights into many hidden structures. We report here our observation based on a graphical representation that the intra-purine and intra-pyrimidine differences in sequences of conserved genes generally follow a quadratic distribution relationship and show that this may have arisen from mutations in the sequences over evolutionary time scales. From this hitherto undescribed relationship for the gene sequences considered in this report we hypothesize that such relationships may be characteristic of these sequences and therefore could become a barrier to large scale sequence alterations that override such characteristics, perhaps through some monitoring process inbuilt in the DNA sequences. Such relationship also raises the possibility of intron sequences playing an important role in maintaining the characteristics and could be indicative of possible intron-late phenomena.",0
Role of nitric oxide in management of acute respiratory distress syndrome,"The current mortality rate of patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is between 45% and 92%, with most dying within the first two weeks of the illness. In an effort to combat such an alarmingly high mortality rate, various treatment therapies such as low tidal volume ventilation strategies, corticosteroid therapy, and use of nitric oxide (NO) have been attempted in the management of patients with ARDS. Three cases which were admitted to the ICU and confirmed to have ARDS were unable to be weaned from ventilatory support, and nitric oxide therapy was initiated. It improved patients' oxygenation for short periods of time but did not affect the mortality. The patients could not be weaned from the ventilator and expired.",0
Cochrane Systematic Reviews of Chinese Herbal Medicines: An Overview,"

This paper provides an overview of systematic reviews from Cochrane Reviews which examine the use of Chinese Herbal Medicine. The authors describe the current state of knowledge regarding the efficacy and safety profiles for Chinese herbal medicines, focusing on their usage in clinical practice. The findings indicate that there is limited evidence to support the use of select plant-based medicines in treating specific health condition, but future controlled trials may provide more objective evidence to validate such traditional treatments. Range studies are needed to evaluate traditional using data gathered over a longer period, as well as a detailed assessment on quality control measures related to its manufacturing process. In conclusion, this article advocates increased investment in healthcare research focusing on medicinal plants and highlights case studies with positive outcomes arising from such interventions. It prompts practitioners while prescribing these herbs due diligence be exercised concerning potential side effects or contraindications with concomitant prescribed drugs or entire other pre-existing medical conditions.",1
"HMGB1, an alarmin promoting HIV dissemination and latency in dendritic cells","

This article explores the impact of high-mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) dissemination and latency in dendritic cells. HMGB1, a ubiquitous multifunctional nuclear protein is upregulated in many inflammatory conditions and has been shown to play an important role during HIV infection by interacting with viral proteins or host cell receptors. Overwhelming evidence suggests that both direct and indirect mechanisms are involved in modulating HIV virulence pathways upon interaction with HMGB1, influencing its dissemination within the central nervous system as well as provoking reactivation from latency. However, further research is required to understand the exact conduit through which HMGB1 acts on the disease progression. The current study analyzes how this alarmin molecule affects not just viral copies being released from reservoirs but also perpetuates systemic inflammation contributing to lifelong management associated complications for those living with HIV/AIDS",1
Stimulation of ribosomal frameshifting by antisense LNA,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting is a translational recoding mechanism commonly used by RNA viruses to express two or more proteins from a single mRNA at a fixed ratio. An essential element in this process is the presence of an RNA secondary structure, such as a pseudoknot or a hairpin, located downstream of the slippery sequence. Here, we have tested the efficiency of RNA oligonucleotides annealing downstream of the slippery sequence to induce frameshifting in vitro. Maximal frameshifting was observed with oligonucleotides of 12–18 nt. Antisense oligonucleotides bearing locked nucleid acid (LNA) modifications also proved to be efficient frameshift-stimulators in contrast to DNA oligonucleotides. The number, sequence and location of LNA bases in an otherwise DNA oligonucleotide have to be carefully manipulated to obtain optimal levels of frameshifting. Our data favor a model in which RNA stability at the entrance of the ribosomal tunnel is the major determinant of stimulating slippage rather than a specific three-dimensional structure of the stimulating RNA element.",0
Complement in Action: An Analysis of Patent Trends from 1976 Through 2011,"

The examination period stretches from 1976 through 2011, providing an overview into how growth dynamics have changed across various industries through the increased use of patent systems for securing technological innovation. Using a database restricted to patents with respect to countries we analyze trends regarding collaborating, competing and complementing patterns within their respective markets in order to provide much needed insight into this research area. Given that patents may influence market performance and industry structure, understanding such networked evolution is imperative for those engaged in policy-making decisions related to patenting in the future.",1
DENV Inhibits Type I IFN Production in Infected Cells by Cleaving Human STING,"

Title: DENV Inhibits Type I IFN Production in Infected Cells by Cleaving Human STING
Changes to the innate immune response are largely responsible for increasing dengue virus (DENV) severity and pathogenesis. A recent study suggests that DENV has developed an ability to disable antiviral interferon production in infected cells through targeting a central signaling molecule known as human stimulator of interferon genes (STING). This article will examine the mechanisms behind this phenomena and discuss the implications that it may have on treatment strategies concerning acute DENV-induced illnesses.  Through gain-of-function experiments, biochemical assays and expression analyses, researchers were able to demonstrate how cleavage of human STING directly intervened with cytosolic DNA sensing pathways necessary for activation of type I IFNs, resulting ultimately in inhibition of these host defenses meant for control over viral infections. In addition, utilization of small molecules demonstrated that cyclization of STING was essential for its full activity against DENV infection; therefore providing understanding into why certain mutations can detract from cellular recognition but still enable replication within a cell environment. Lastly, results clarified details regarding prerequisites pertaining to efficient triggering yet particular accuracy needed within and between aspects of both vRNA sensing systems acts synergistically against the virus. Overall, these findings depict novel insight into inhibitions carried out by DENV onto human cellular defense networks during an infectious cycle by attacking specific target sites like STING required for proper regulatory control over type I interferons production which could serve great significance towards further vaccine or drug developments towards eradication dengue infection worldwide",1
Effect modification of environmental factors on influenza-associated mortality: a time-series study in two Chinese cities,"

This paper explores the effect modification of environmental factors on influenza-associated mortality in two Chinese cities, using time-series analysis. Seasonal variations of mortality were evaluated according to both total numbers and proportionates due to influenza related death with different ambient temperature, relative humidity and air pollution. To gain insight on seasonal trends, autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models combined with generalized linear model (GLM) were developed from 2016-2018 data retrieved from National Health Statistics in China. Results showed that the effects of environmental variables seem more prominent during winter season comparing to summer among two study areas when compared their Adjusted R2 values for ARIMA+GLM models. This research result will enhance our understanding on how a complex interplay between environment exposure such as meteorology and air quality affect health outcomes like underling medical conditions and may provide additional consideration framing public health policy pressing issues like future pandemic preparedness or climate change mitigation measures as part of compliance strategy in either city level or provincial domain.",1
Host-protective effect of circulating pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and complex formation with neutrophil extracellular traps,"

""Host-protective effect of circulating pentraxin 3 (PTX3) and complex formation with neutrophil extracellular traps"" investigates how an evolutionally conserved molecule, PTX3, shapes the host's holistic anti-bacterial defense. In a novel approach, this study aims to define the relevance of DNA-neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) crosslinking by PTX3 for bacterial growth inhibition in vitro, and then validate its clinical significance in human bacteremia. Through cytometeric analysis of NETs formed under varied concentrations of PTX3 incubated with Klebsiella pneumoniae as well as measurements for immune cell uptake efficiency and neurotoxin release by confocal microscopy imaging under identical conditions; we demonstrate that higher concentrations correlate with significantly enhanced protection from bacteria invasion through direct binding leading to phagocytosis or disrupting bacterial membrane via pore formation. Our findings reveal previously unknown ability of this intrinsic factor to foster pro-inflammatory responses against invading microorganisms and those targeting pathogenic transformation by encapsulating them into stiff polymeric networks thereby curbing their spread inside body tissues.  Furthermore, experimentation on patient data collected over period 2014 - 2016 reveals adequate correlations between plasma PTX3 levels elevations in septic shock patients successfully combatted K.pneumonia infection against severely ill counterparts who were overcome notwithstanding temporary swings in circulating quantitative profiles indicating insight into a novel link between microbial elimination defensive mechanisms triggered within bloodstream downscaled upon severe disease progression prior further more intensive outcome centric studies planned ahead",1
A host type I interferon response is induced by cytosolic sensing of the bacterial second messenger cyclic-di-GMP,"The innate immune system responds to unique molecular signatures that are widely conserved among microbes but that are not normally present in host cells. Compounds that stimulate innate immune pathways may be valuable in the design of novel adjuvants, vaccines, and other immunotherapeutics. The cyclic dinucleotide cyclic-di–guanosine monophosphate (c-di-GMP) is a recently appreciated second messenger that plays critical regulatory roles in many species of bacteria but is not produced by eukaryotic cells. In vivo and in vitro studies have previously suggested that c-di-GMP is a potent immunostimulatory compound recognized by mouse and human cells. We provide evidence that c-di-GMP is sensed in the cytosol of mammalian cells via a novel immunosurveillance pathway. The potency of cytosolic signaling induced by c-di-GMP is comparable to that induced by cytosolic delivery of DNA, and both nucleic acids induce a similar transcriptional profile, including triggering of type I interferons and coregulated genes via induction of TBK1, IRF3, nuclear factor κB, and MAP kinases. However, the cytosolic pathway that senses c-di-GMP appears to be distinct from all known nucleic acid–sensing pathways. Our results suggest a novel mechanism by which host cells can induce an inflammatory response to a widely produced bacterial ligand.",0
A simplified procedure for the subtractive cDNA cloning of photoassimilate-responding genes: isolation of cDNAs encoding a new class of pathogenesis-related proteins," 

This paper presents the development of a new and improved subtractive cDNA cloning procedure for the isolation of cDNAs encoding Photoassimilate-Responding (PAR) proteins, enabling genetic analysis and manipulation of plant cells. Traditional hereditary research methods involving PAR genes using existing promoters have been severely limited by lack of high throughput approaches in both cost and complexity. Through our simplified protocol involving selective hybridizations with targeted subtraction probes, we were able to successfully isolate two novel PR1 families containing four clones which encode an unlimited number of photoassimilates that could potentially be used as target genes in future generation biotechnology applications. In further studies, these proteins were isolated from a wide variety of species ranging from vegetables to algae, indicating their broad range of possible uses in many different contexts. Through this combined approach utilizing optimized genetic engineering techniques for selection and amplification, we established several promising lines for investigating various aspects related to photosynthesis regarding control mechanisms associated with positive phototrophic growth promotion or negative stress response formation. Ultimately, this method will provide researchers and plant breeders the ability to precisely identify the roles performed by each gene within a given family, allowing greater accuracy when targeting specific individual components over traditional indirect Single Gene Transformations (SGTs). This highly efficient method provides significant advantages compared to former strategies employing vector cloning hybrids or semi-pure feeder cell extractions",1
Evaluation of Approaches to Identify the Targets of Cellular Immunity on a Proteome-Wide Scale,"

The immune system is one of the most complex biological systems and plays an important role in defending us from pathogens. Despite its complexity, it remains a challenge to identify its cellular targets on a proteome-wide scale. In this study, we investigated multiple approaches to address this problem. We evaluated each approach's strengths and weaknesses according to several criteria such as accuracy, coverage of immunogenic regions, computational resources needed, functional information attainable and cost effectiveness. By combining these parameters with existing knowledge about immune components, we systematically identified potential target proteins at both subcellular and organismal levels for more accurate therapeutic interventions against disease pathology. The overall results suggest that some current methods may be suitable for targeted detection on various types of cells whereas others should require further optimization before reaching their full utility in cell immunity identification tasks. We thus hypothesize that combining different approaches could lead to novel insights into identifying possible regulatory mechanisms underneath recognised clinical states or the development of inflammation aggravation symptoms due to abnormal T-cell activity associated with autoimmune disorders. This research provides evidence supporting the use of our proposed strategies as efficient alternatives for effective generation of data required when aiming at deeper understanding cellular immunity dynamics within biomedical settings",1
"Sentinel surveillance for human enterovirus 71 in Sarawak, Malaysia: lessons from the first 7 years","BACKGROUND: A major outbreak of human enterovirus 71-associated hand, foot and mouth disease in Sarawak in 1997 marked the beginning of a series of outbreaks in the Asia Pacific region. Some of these outbreaks had unusually high numbers of fatalities and this generated much fear and anxiety in the region. METHODS: We established a sentinel surveillance programme for hand, foot and mouth disease in Sarawak, Malaysia, in March 1998, and the observations of the first 7 years are described here. Virus isolation, serotyping and genotyping were performed on throat, rectal, vesicle and other swabs. RESULTS: During this period Sarawak had two outbreaks of human enterovirus 71, in 2000 and 2003. The predominant strains circulating in the outbreaks of 1997, 2000 and 2003 were all from genogroup B, but the strains isolated during each outbreak were genetically distinct from each other. Human enterovirus 71 outbreaks occurred in a cyclical pattern every three years and Coxsackievirus A16 co-circulated with human enterovirus 71. Although vesicles were most likely to yield an isolate, this sample was not generally available from most cases and obtaining throat swabs was thus found to be the most efficient way to obtain virological information. CONCLUSION: Knowledge of the epidemiology of human enterovirus 71 transmission will allow public health personnel to predict when outbreaks might occur and to plan interventions in an effective manner in order to reduce the burden of disease.",0
Clinical review: Mass casualty triage – pandemic influenza and critical care,"Worst case scenarios for pandemic influenza planning in the US involve over 700,000 patients requiring mechanical ventilation. UK planning predicts a 231% occupancy of current level 3 (intensive care unit) bed capacity. Critical care planners need to recognise that mortality is likely to be high and the risk to healthcare workers significant. Contingency planning should, therefore, be multi-faceted, involving a robust health command structure, the facility to expand critical care provision in terms of space, equipment and staff and cohorting of affected patients in the early stages. It should also be recognised that despite this expansion of critical care, demand will exceed supply and a process for triage needs to be developed that is valid, reproducible, transparent and consistent with distributive justice. We advocate the development and validation of physiological scores for use as a triage tool, coupled with candid public discussion of the process.",0
Virus-Specific Read-Through Codon Preference Affects Infectivity of Chimeric Cucumber Green Mottle Mosaic Viruses Displaying a Dengue Virus Epitope,"A Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) was used to present a truncated dengue virus type 2 envelope (E) protein binding region from amino acids 379 to 423 (EB4). The EB4 gene was inserted at the terminal end of the CGMMV coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF). Read-through sequences of TMV or CGMMV, CAA-UAG-CAA-UUA, or AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA were, respectively, inserted in between the CP and the EB4 genes. The chimeric clones, pRT, pRG, and pCG+FSRTRE, were transcribed into full-length capped recombinant CGMMV transcripts. Only constructs with the wild-type CGMMV read-through sequence yielded infectious viruses following infection of host plant, muskmelon (Cucumis melo) leaves. The ratio of modified to unmodified CP for the read-through expression clone developed was also found to be approximately 1:1, higher than what has been previously reported. It was also observed that infectivity was not affected by differences in pI between the chimera and its wild counterpart. Analysis of recombinant viruses after 21-days-postinculation (dpi) revealed that deletions occurred resulting in partial reversions of the viral population to near wild type and suggesting that this would be the limiting harvest period for obtaining true to type recombinants with this construct.",0
Recombination Every Day: Abundant Recombination in a Virus during a Single Multi-Cellular Host Infection,"Viral recombination can dramatically impact evolution and epidemiology. In viruses, the recombination rate depends on the frequency of genetic exchange between different viral genomes within an infected host cell and on the frequency at which such co-infections occur. While the recombination rate has been recently evaluated in experimentally co-infected cell cultures for several viruses, direct quantification at the most biologically significant level, that of a host infection, is still lacking. This study fills this gap using the cauliflower mosaic virus as a model. We distributed four neutral markers along the viral genome, and co-inoculated host plants with marker-containing and wild-type viruses. The frequency of recombinant genomes was evaluated 21 d post-inoculation. On average, over 50% of viral genomes recovered after a single host infection were recombinants, clearly indicating that recombination is very frequent in this virus. Estimates of the recombination rate show that all regions of the genome are equally affected by this process. Assuming that ten viral replication cycles occurred during our experiment—based on data on the timing of coat protein detection—the per base and replication cycle recombination rate was on the order of 2 × 10(−5) to 4 × 10(−5). This first determination of a virus recombination rate during a single multi-cellular host infection indicates that recombination is very frequent in the everyday life of this virus.",0
Association and Host Selectivity in Multi-Host Pathogens,"The distribution of multi-host pathogens over their host range conditions their population dynamics and structure. Also, host co-infection by different pathogens may have important consequences for the evolution of hosts and pathogens, and host-pathogen co-evolution. Hence it is of interest to know if the distribution of pathogens over their host range is random, or if there are associations between hosts and pathogens, or between pathogens sharing a host. To analyse these issues we propose indices for the observed patterns of host infection by pathogens, and for the observed patterns of co-infection, and tests to analyse if these patterns conform to randomness or reflect associations. Applying these tests to the prevalence of five plant viruses on 21 wild plant species evidenced host-virus associations: most hosts and viruses were selective for viruses and hosts, respectively. Interestingly, the more host-selective viruses were the more prevalent ones, suggesting that host specialisation is a successful strategy for multi-host pathogens. Analyses also showed that viruses tended to associate positively in co-infected hosts. The developed indices and tests provide the tools to analyse how strong and common are these associations among different groups of pathogens, which will help to understand and model the population biology of multi-host pathogens.",0
"Injection drug use and HIV/AIDS in China: Review of current situation, prevention and policy implications","Illicit drug abuse and HIV/AIDS have increased rapidly in the past 10 to 20 years in China. This paper reviews drug abuse in China, the HIV/AIDS epidemic and its association with injection drug use (IDU), and Chinese policies on illicit drug abuse and prevention of HIV/AIDS based on published literature and unpublished official data. As a major drug trans-shipment country with source drugs from the ""Golden Triangle"" and ""Gold Crescent"" areas in Asia, China has also become an increasingly important drug consuming market. About half of China's 1.14 million documented drug users inject, and many share needles. IDU has contributed to 42% of cumulatively reported HIV/AIDS cases thus far. Drug trafficking is illegal in China and can lead to the death penalty. The public security departments adopt ""zero tolerance"" approach to drug use, which conflict with harm reduction policies of the public health departments. Past experience in China suggests that cracking down on drug smuggling and prohibiting drug use alone can not prevent or solve all illicit drug related problems in the era of globalization. In recent years, the central government has outlined a series of pragmatic policies to encourage harm reduction programs; meanwhile, some local governments have not fully mobilized to deal with drug abuse and HIV/AIDS problems seriously. Strengthening government leadership at both central and local levels; scaling up methadone substitution and needle exchange programs; making HIV voluntary counseling and testing available and affordable to both urban and rural drug users; and increasing utilization of outreach and nongovernmental organizations are offered as additional strategies to help cope with China's HIV and drug abuse problem.",0
Heliox reduces respiratory system resistance in respiratory syncytial virus induced respiratory failure,"INTRODUCTION: Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract disease is characterised by narrowing of the airways resulting in increased airway resistance, air-trapping and respiratory acidosis. These problems might be overcome using helium-oxygen gas mixture. However, the effect of mechanical ventilation with heliox in these patients is unclear. The objective of this prospective cross-over study was to determine the effects of mechanical ventilation with heliox 60/40 versus conventional gas on respiratory system resistance, air-trapping and CO2 removal. METHODS: Mechanically ventilated, sedated and paralyzed infants with proven RSV were enrolled within 24 hours after paediatric intensive care unit (PICU)admission. At T = 0, respiratory system mechanics including respiratory system compliance and resistance, and peak expiratory flow rate were measured with the AVEA ventilator. The measurements were repeated at each interval (after 30 minutes of ventilation with heliox, after 30 minutes of ventilation with nitrox and again after 30 minutes of ventilation with heliox). Indices of gas exchange (ventilation and oxygenation index) were calculated at each interval. Air-trapping (defined by relative change in end-expiratory lung volume) was determined by electrical impedance tomography (EIT) at each interval. RESULTS: Thirteen infants were enrolled. In nine, EIT measurements were performed. Mechanical ventilation with heliox significantly decreased respiratory system resistance. This was not accompanied by an improved CO2 elimination, decreased peak expiratory flow rate or decreased end-expiratory lung volume. Importantly, oxygenation remained unaltered throughout the experimental protocol. CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory system resistance is significantly decreased by mechanical ventilation with heliox (ISCRTN98152468).",0
Lipid Rafts and Alzheimer’s Disease: Protein-Lipid Interactions and Perturbation of Signaling,"

This paper investigates the role of physical protein-lipid interactions in the perturbation of cellular antagonism caused by Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). We focus on lipid rafts as potential platforms for modulating neuronal pathology, such as tau aggregation and amyloid-beta misfolding. To understand these complex processes to allow improvement of current therapeutics, we review experimental evidence describing regulation through cholesterol metabolism, explore what is known on the atomic-level forces driving protein binding to model membrane lipids, and consider available data on clinical drug trials targeting lipid rafts in human AD patients. Our comprehensive overview reveals an intricate relationship between AD pathology, cell signaling and composition of microdomains that necessitate further exploration virtually at all levels - from molecules to individual organisms.",1
On managing complex adaptive systems motivated by biosystems application to infections,Many attempts to control Complex adaptive systems (CAS) have failed. Here we try to learn from biosystems to derive some principles for CAS management. An application to managing infections is given.,0
Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS): A Trust-Based Network,"

This paper provides an overview of the Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS): A Trust-Based Network, and examines how trust is cultivated among members. The MBDS was established in 2000 to improve surveillance, detection and response capacities for high impact infectious diseases across six countries: Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand Vietnam and parts of China. This network has become essential in the fight against epidemics such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), Avian Influenza H5N1, Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) as well as various other communicable illnesses endemic to the region with a focus on training front line professionals at all levels. Reflecting on factors which encourage collaboration between members; trust is considered to be a primary factor allowing institutions from varying backgrounds come together. By recognizing risk thresholds expected by each member within the network and respecting deontological principles based on moral responsibility built upon mutual understanding and cooperation rather then force or coercion trustees are better able to share useful information that promotes sustainability through collective action for optimal health outcomes throughout southeast Asia.",1
Dynamic features of cells expressing macrophage properties in tissue cultures of dissociated cerebral cortex from the rat,"

This study investigates the dynamic features of cells expressing macrophage properties in tissue cultures derived from dissociated cerebral cortex tissues of rats. After isolating and characterizing neurons, glia, and other non-cell material components in this preparation, various cellular assays were conducted to investigate the phenotypic characteristics of identified macrophages under varying conditions. Additionally, imaging studies allowed for the quantitative analysis of these processes over time using multiple markers. Our results demonstrate a high degree of heterogeneity among expressed macrophages that was found to vary depending on age and treatment regimen. These findings provide insight into the role these osteoclastic or proinflammatory immune cells may play during development as well as how they could be affected by external factors such as chemotherapeutic agents or diseases like Alzheimer's. Ultimately, our research offers new understanding about how changes in environment can influence expression patterns of different cell types when exposed to an ever changing environmental context within host organisms.",1
A Three-Dimensional Comparison of Tick-Borne Flavivirus Infection in Mammalian and Tick Cell Lines,"

This paper investigates the comparative efficacy of tick-borne flavivirus infection in mammalian and tick cell lines. The three-dimensional comparison seeks to analyze the effects of viral entry, replication, assembly and exit on host defense mechanisms between these two types of cells. Through this investigation, insights are revealed into how different cell lineages influence virus invasion strategies and thus helps elucidate potential therapeutic interventions capable of mitigating or preventing such infections altogether. Additionally, this study offers valuable insight into evolutionary relationships that may ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of tick ecology with respect to viruses as pathogens. To explore these themes further we carried out an evaluation using multiplex fluorescent imaging across suitable animal models suffering from Flaviviridae infection. We report a unique correlation linking cell type susceptibility level with host response at various stages throughout the disease’s trajectory by identifying host protein markers associated with intracellular viral protection which provided more definitive data in terms of gene expression patterns affected by particular variants within each group showing limited cross-over effect between them",1
Evidence of Recombination and Genetic Diversity in Human Rhinoviruses in Children with Acute Respiratory Infection,"BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are a highly prevalent cause of acute respiratory infection in children. They are classified into at least three species, HRV-A, HRV-B and HRV-C, which are characterized by sequencing the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) or the VP4/VP2 region of the genome. Given the increased interest for novel HRV strain identification and their worldwide distribution, we have carried out clinical and molecular diagnosis of HRV strains in a 2-year study of children with acute respiratory infection visiting one district hospital in Shanghai. METHODOLOGY/FINDINGS: We cloned and sequenced a 924-nt fragment that covered part of the 5′UTR and the VP4/VP2 capsid genes. Sixty-four HRV-infected outpatients were diagnosed amongst 827 children with acute low respiratory tract infection. Two samples were co-infected with HRV-A and HRV-B or HRV-C. By comparative analysis of the VP4/VP2 sequences of the 66 HRVs, we showed a high diversity of strains in HRV-A and HRV-B species, and a prevalence of 51.5% of strains that belonged to the recently identified HRV-C species. When analyzing a fragment of the 5′ UTR, we characterized at least two subspecies of HRV-C: HRV-Cc, which clustered differently from HRV-A and HRV-B, and HRV-Ca, which resulted from previous recombination in this region with sequences related to HRV-A. The full-length sequence of one strain of each HRV-Ca and HRV-Cc subspecies was obtained for comparative analysis. We confirmed the close relationship of their structural proteins but showed apparent additional recombination events in the 2A gene and 3′UTR of the HRV-Ca strain. Double or triple infections with HRV-C and respiratory syncytial virus and/or bocavirus were diagnosed in 33.3% of the HRV-infected patients, but no correlation with severity of clinical outcome was observed. CONCLUSION: Our study showed a high diversity of HRV strains that cause bronchitis and pneumonia in children. A predominance of HRV-C over HRV-A and HRV-B was observed, and two subspecies of HRV-C were identified, the diversity of which seemed to be related to recombination with former HRV-A strains. None of the HRV-C strains appeared to have a higher clinical impact than HRV-A or HRV-B on respiratory compromise.",0
Identification of serum proteomic biomarkers for early porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) infection,"

The purpose of this study was to determine whether serum proteomic biomarkers can be used for early detection of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) infection. The identification of such biomarkers could aid in the control and elimination of PRRS across pig herds, by enabling faster recognition and targeting of outbreaks in pigs. This would ultimately reduce the impact on animal performance, improve productivity, and decrease costs associated with production losses due to disease mortality. Serum samples from 64 clinically healthy, virus-exposed but seronegative six month old swine were collected before clinical signs appeared and after these animals were challenged with the Lihe strain. These serum profiles were compared against a database established using four PRRS-positive regionally adapted strains representative of distinct genetic classifications (PC195A/VR2332, NML8907/Harleyville117a2bMv1 subtype II EU, RPRSV‑IL‑12‑3 C449660, D127–00KH145XLA 4va) derived from three countries to identify potential novel biomarkers specific for early stage infection . Proteomics technology coupled with an optimized statistical analysis pipeline identified 62 common proteins between infected groups over noninfected controls characteristics. Among these are thyroid peroxidase isoform P8632_PIG 1 which displayed upregulation after challenge suggesting it as a possible signature marker affecting host immunity during acute phases followed by other related lipid binding transporters like fatty acid binding protein 11B family member A1 which may play a role supporting the immune system’s adaptive response upon resurgence or continuous pro-inflammatory phase signaling chronic exposures to antigens induced by prolonged infectious conditions like existent in cases related to enzootic persistence onset models widely reported leading fatal outcomes in classical PRRS endemic scenarios as expected outcome according epidemiological trends already registered around key areas where viral presence is historically well documented . Identifying serum proteomic biomarkers for Early Porcine Reproductive & Respiratory Syndrome Infection will provide novel opportunities for reducing loss incurred due to this devastating disease",1
Severe malaria - a case of fatal Plasmodium knowlesi infection with post-mortem findings: a case report,"BACKGROUND: Zoonotic malaria caused by Plasmodium knowlesi is an important, but newly recognized, human pathogen. For the first time, post-mortem findings from a fatal case of knowlesi malaria are reported here. CASE PRESENTATION: A formerly healthy 40 year-old male became symptomatic 10 days after spending time in the jungle of North Borneo. Four days later, he presented to hospital in a state of collapse and died within two hours. He was hyponatraemic and had elevated blood urea, potassium, lactate dehydrogenase and amino transferase values; he was also thrombocytopenic and eosinophilic. Dengue haemorrhagic shock was suspected and a post-mortem examination performed. Investigations for dengue virus were negative. Blood for malaria parasites indicated hyperparasitaemia and single species P. knowlesi infection was confirmed by nested-PCR. Macroscopic pathology of the brain and endocardium showed multiple petechial haemorrhages, the liver and spleen were enlarged and lungs had features consistent with ARDS. Microscopic pathology showed sequestration of pigmented parasitized red blood cells in the vessels of the cerebrum, cerebellum, heart and kidney without evidence of chronic inflammatory reaction in the brain or any other organ examined. Brain sections were negative for intracellular adhesion molecule-1. The spleen and liver had abundant pigment containing macrophages and parasitized red blood cells. The kidney had evidence of acute tubular necrosis and endothelial cells in heart sections were prominent. CONCLUSIONS: The overall picture in this case was one of systemic malaria infection that fit the WHO classification for severe malaria. Post-mortem findings in this case were unexpectedly similar to those that define fatal falciparum malaria, including cerebral pathology. There were important differences including the absence of coma despite petechial haemorrhages and parasite sequestration in the brain. These results suggest that further study of knowlesi malaria will aid the interpretation of, often conflicting, information on malaria pathophysiology in humans.",0
High Fidelity Processing and Activation of the Human α-Defensin HNP1 Precursor by Neutrophil Elastase and Proteinase 3,"

This paper investigates the high fidelity activation of a particular human precursor protein, Human neutrophil peptide 1 (HNP1), which is carried out by Neutrophil Elastase (NE) and Proteinase 3 (PR3). Our findings reveal that HNP1 has a substantially higher cleavage efficiency when activated by NE or PR3 compared to other elastases. Moreover, we have developed an innovative method based on fluorescence spectroscopy to monitor in real-time the processing of HNP1 with NE or PR3 in vitro. Through our studies, we discover significant insights into the enzymatic activities and substrates preferences for both enzymes as well as their substrate commercial availability respectively. Finally, our analysis illustrates how knowledge about these activities can be used for clinical purposes such as proteolytic therapy for diseases caused by microbial infections.",1
Discovery and Development of Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) Antagonists: A New Paradigm for Treating Sepsis and Other Diseases,"Sepsis remains the most common cause of death in intensive care units in the USA, with a current estimate of at least 750,000 cases per year, and 215,000 deaths annually. Despite extensive research still we do not quite understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that are involved in triggering and propagation of septic injury. Endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide from Gram-negative bacteria, or LPS) has been implicated as a major cause of this syndrome. Inflammatory shock as a consequence of LPS release remains a serious clinical concern. In humans, inflammatory responses to LPS result in the release of cytokines and other cell mediators from monocytes and macrophages, which can cause fever, shock, organ failure and death. A number of different approaches have been investigated to try to treat and/or prevent the septic shock associated with infections caused by Gram-negative bacteria, including blockage of one or more of the cytokines induced by LPS. Recently several novel amphipathic compounds have been developed as direct LPS antagonists at the LPS receptor, TLR4. This review article will outline the current knowledge on the TLR4-LPS synthesis and discuss the signaling, in vitro pre-clinical and in vivo clinical evaluation of TLR4 antagonists and their potential use in sepsis and a variety of diseases such as atherosclerosis as well as hepatic and renal malfunction.",0
Growth of exocrine acinar cells on a reconstituted basement membrane gel,"

The article, 'Growth of exocrine acinar cells on a reconstituted basement membrane gel' investigates the potential of 3D systems to improve adhesion and growth in pancreatic-derived exocrine acinar cells. By replicating basal composition, structure and components of extracellular matrix that are found in vivo using recombinant proteins, a reconstructed basement membrane (rBM) is developed for this purpose. The objective of this study is to analyze the influence of rBM gel on 18 differentially expressed gene products related to cell adhesion and apoptosis over an eight-day period while quantifying changes in cell morphology also upon treatment with various growth factors. It is expected that activity within these pathways will be compared between 2D monolayer cultures vs cultured under 3D conditions when supplemented with various growth factors thus allowing us to comprehend functional effects caused by environment transition from 2D to 3D systems better.",1
The calculation of information and organismal complexity,"BACKGROUND: It is difficult to measure precisely the phenotypic complexity of living organisms. Here we propose a method to calculate the minimal amount of genomic information needed to construct organism (effective information) as a measure of organismal complexity, by using permutation and combination formulas and Shannon's information concept. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that the calculated information correlates quite well with the intuitive organismal phenotypic complexity defined by traditional taxonomy and evolutionary theory. From viruses to human beings, the effective information gradually increases, from thousands of bits to hundreds of millions of bits. The simpler the organism is, the less the information; the more complex the organism, the more the information. About 13% of human genome is estimated as effective information or functional sequence. CONCLUSIONS: The effective information can be used as a quantitative measure of phenotypic complexity of living organisms and also as an estimate of functional fraction of genome.

Supreme Emergencies Without the Bad Guys,"

This paper investigates the overlooked concept of supreme emergencies - disasters and catastrophic events that don't require any villains, perpetrators, or evident bad guys. Supreme emergencies add yet another emergency type to supplement existing definitions and afford a novel approach for better risk management through preventative responses. Using concepts from crisis communication research, this paper uncovers emergent trends in emergency management by discussing case studies of three different areas subjected to supreme emergency scenarios: a landslide in India; poor weather conditions leading to crop failure; and an invasion of aquatic plants disrupting water systems in Asia. Finally we develop conclusions about preparing for unpredictable nature-related events as well as create policy implications based on identified strategies suitable for such unique circumstances.",1
Assessment of Virally Vectored Autoimmunity as a Biocontrol Strategy for Cane Toads,"BACKGROUND: The cane toad, Bufo (Chaunus) marinus, is one of the most notorious vertebrate pests introduced into Australia over the last 200 years and, so far, efforts to identify a naturally occurring B. marinus-specific pathogen for use as a biological control agent have been unsuccessful. We explored an alternative approach that entailed genetically modifying a pathogen with broad host specificity so that it no longer caused disease, but carried a gene to disrupt the cane toad life cycle in a species specific manner. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The adult beta globin gene was selected as the model gene for proof of concept of autoimmunity as a biocontrol method for cane toads. A previous report showed injection of bullfrog tadpoles with adult beta globin resulted in an alteration in the form of beta globin expressed in metamorphs as well as reduced survival. In B. marinus we established for the first time that the switch from tadpole to adult globin exists. The effect of injecting B. marinus tadpoles with purified recombinant adult globin protein was then assessed using behavioural (swim speed in tadpoles and jump length in metamorphs), developmental (time to metamorphosis, weight and length at various developmental stages, protein profile of adult globin) and genetic (adult globin mRNA levels) measures. However, we were unable to detect any differences between treated and control animals. Further, globin delivery using Bohle iridovirus, an Australian ranavirus isolate belonging to the Iridovirus family, did not reduce the survival of metamorphs or alter the form of beta globin expressed in metamorphs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: While we were able to show for the first time that the switch from tadpole to adult globin does occur in B. marinus, we were not able to induce autoimmunity and disrupt metamorphosis. The short development time of B. marinus tadpoles may preclude this approach.",0
Relapsing macrophage activating syndrome in a 15-year-old girl with Still's disease: a case report,"INTRODUCTION: Macrophage activating syndrome is a severe, potentially life-threatening condition that may accompany Still's disease. It is characterized by fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, severe cytopenia, serious liver dysfunction, coagulopathy and neurologic involvement. The principal treatment for patients with this syndrome includes etoposide 150 mg/2 M twice a week for two weeks, dexamethasone 10 mg/2 M for two weeks and cyclosporine 3 mg/kg to 5 mg/kg for a longer period. Cases of relapse of macrophage activating syndrome are relatively rare. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of a 15-year-old Iraqi girl with Still's disease who developed macrophage activating syndrome with acute respiratory distress syndrome that required resuscitation and mechanical ventilation. Following intensive treatment, including high dose steroids and cyclosporine, the patient improved significantly. Two weeks after cyclosporine was discontinued, however, she was readmitted with an acute relapse of macrophage activating syndrome manifested by spiking fever, arthralgias, maculopapular rash and leukocytosis. This time the patient recovered following the reintroduction of treatment with cyclosporine and the addition of mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept). CONCLUSION: We believe that cyclosporine is a cornerstone for the treatment of Still's disease. We recommend continuing this medication for several weeks following the patient's clinical recovery in order to prevent macrophage activating syndrome relapses.",0
"Immunologic Changes during Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, China","

This paper sets to provide a review of the immunologic changes during pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in China. We analyzed data from patients' clinical records and regional surveillance data over two years, spanning 2008-2009. Our resultse suggest that significant while substantial increases were observed in some cytokine levels specific to influenza viruses occurred concomitant with this outbreak. This provides additional evidence for an increased susceptibility to infection leading to greater morbidity associated with H1N1 virus infections compared due to failure in removing antigenic stimulation and allowing multiple rounds of viral replication. The present study thus highlights critical level information regarding immunology characteristics during an influenza Outbreak which could be harnessed for improved treatment regimens and vaccines design development strategies in future outbreaks.",1
An object simulation model for modeling hypothetical disease epidemics – EpiFlex,"BACKGROUND: EpiFlex is a flexible, easy to use computer model for a single computer, intended to be operated by one user who need not be an expert. Its purpose is to study in-silico the epidemic behavior of a wide variety of diseases, both known and theoretical, by simulating their spread at the level of individuals contracting and infecting others. To understand the system fully, this paper must be read together in conjunction with study of the software and its results. EpiFlex is evaluated using results from modeling influenza A epidemics and comparing them with a variety of field data sources and other types of modeling. EpiFlex is an object-oriented Monte Carlo system, allocating entities to correspond to individuals, disease vectors, diseases, and the locations that hosts may inhabit. EpiFlex defines eight different contact types available for a disease. Contacts occur inside locations within the model. Populations are composed of demographic groups, each of which has a cycle of movement between locations. Within locations, superspreading is defined by skewing of contact distributions. RESULTS: EpiFlex indicates three phenomena of interest for public health: (1) R(0 )is variable, and the smaller the population, the larger the infected fraction within that population will be; (2) significant compression/synchronization between cities by a factor of roughly 2 occurs between the early incubation phase of a multi-city epidemic and the major manifestation phase; (3) if better true morbidity data were available, more asymptomatic hosts would be seen to spread disease than we currently believe is the case for influenza. These results suggest that field research to study such phenomena, while expensive, should be worthwhile. CONCLUSION: Since EpiFlex shows all stages of disease progression, detailed insight into the progress of epidemics is possible. EpiFlex shows the characteristic multimodality and apparently random variation characteristic of real world data, but does so as an emergent property of a carefully constructed model of disease dynamics and is not simply a stochastic system. EpiFlex can provide a better understanding of infectious diseases and strategies for response.",0
Identification of a novel Getah virus by Virus-Discovery-cDNA random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD),"

This paper presents the identification of a novel Getah virus by combining PCR and Virus-Discovery-cDNA random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Recent years have seen an alarming increase in the prevalence of vector-borne diseases caused by arboviruses. Of these, Getah and its associated vector, mites, is a major health hazard of global significance. To address this challenge, we utilized Virus-Discovery-cDNA RAPD to generate cDNAs from two pools of mite species collected from various locations worldwide. These were then subjected to PCR for virus detection and subsequent cloning into plasmid vectors for further analysis. Our results revealed that one pool had significantly higher viral titers than another pool. Sequencing analyses further confirmed the presence of seven different types of Getah viruses along with full length sequences on each sample type showing considerable variation in gene organization and size suggesting distinct evolutionary pathways as well as diversity among members within each group. Altogether our findings demonstrate utilization of modern molecular techniques such as cDNA RAPD can be harnessed to detect diverse strains/variants in vitro which may aid future design strategies for rapid diagnosis and relief treatment options against emerging pestiferous arbovirus threats like Getah that threaten global public health safety standards uniformly across all nations globally.",1
RNA-Seq Based Transcriptional Map of Bovine Respiratory Disease Pathogen “Histophilus somni 2336”,"

This article presents the first comprehensive description of the transcriptomic landscape of Histophilus somni 2336, a crucial pathogen in bovine respiratory diseases. The method to be employed is high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) which enables a large-scale study of gene expression associated with this disease, allowing for a better understanding of its molecular mechanisms. Results from this study are expected to provide valuable insight into the virulence factors and differentially expressed genes responsible for H. somni 2336 pathology, ultimately opening up new prospects  for improving our knowledge on development and treatment options relevant to bovine respiratory illnesses.",1
Human Anti-CCR4 Minibody Gene Transfer for the Treatment of Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma,"

Cutaneous T-Cell Lymphoma (CTCL) is a rare and highly aggressive hematological malignancy that affects the skin, causing itching, scaling, redness or bumps. Limited therapeutic options for this disease have led to the development of various strategies aimed at targeting specific molecules involved in its pathogenesis. The present study investigates the potential role of human anti-CCR4 minibody gene transfer as a treatment option in CTCL using an innovative murine model system. Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated and transfected with a lentiviral vector encoding an anti-human CCR4 minibody gene. Cells displaying high levels of surface expression of this construct were sorted by FACS and then injected into mouse models presenting with two different forms of aggressive CTCL: Mycosis Fungoides and Sézary Syndrome Lesions upon subcutaneous injection reduced considerably compared to untreated mice within 1 week of administration indicating such approach may be effective for treating patient's suffering from Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma. Further research needs to be performed to assess whether such strategy can translate successfully from preclinical studies onto clinical practice given Minobodies are largely considered safe biopharmaceutical drugs with minimal systemic toxicity when compared conventionally used chemotherapeutics.",1
"Human Cardioviruses, Meningitis, and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome in Children","

This paper examines the role of human cardioviruses in relation to meningitis and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). With an increasing rate of SIDS, it is important to understand the impact that viruses may have on children. This study will explore the potential linkage between viral infections and immunological factors associated with these fatal illnesses in young children. By identifying connections between viral loads and physiological parameters in a clinical dataset, we can identify ways to reduce development or risk of complications from such conditions.",1
"Knowledge of Avian Influenza (H5N1) among Poultry Workers, Hong Kong, China"," 

Knowledge of risks associated with Avian Influenza (H5N1) among poultry workers in Hong Kong, China, is lacking due to the high demand for their work. This paper investigates Hong Kong poultry workers’ self-reported knowledge of H5N1 and its impact on preventive behaviour. We conducted a survey consisting of specially designed structured questionnaires to evaluate the poultry worker's level of knowledge while also acertaining attitudes towards safety guidelines and preventive practices. The results suggest that education campaigns geared towards improving understanding and awareness are needed targeting this group specifically in order to improve risk behavious related to H5N1 infection within this population.",1
Effectiveness of Integrated HIV Prevention Interventions among Chinese Men Who Have Sex with Men: Evaluation of a 16-City Public Health Program,"

The HIV/AIDS pandemic has disproportionately impacted vulnerable populations including men who have sex with men (MSM). To address this, the Chinese government implemented an integrated 16-city public health program to increase access to and effectiveness of prevention interventions for MSM. This paper evaluates the impact of that program on reducing HIV prevalence among identified participant groups in representative cities. 

We begin by conducting a comprehensive review of existing datasets examining relevant factors and sociocultural differences. Building from those findings, we use a mixed methods quantitative analysis to evaluate whether planning-level changes successfully translated into actionable outcomes at both the individual level and citywide scale. Our results are then used to assess success levels and make recommendations for future integrated prevention strategies. The study provides valuable insights into public health policy efficacy in highly populated areas around China as well as identify potential obstacles which hinder effective implementation of such strategies within high risk communities like MSM populations living in urban settings across China.",1
Altered Thymic Function during Interferon Therapy in HCV-Infected Patients,"

This paper focuses on the alteration of thymic immunity during interferon therapy in HCV-infected patients. Persistent hepatitis C infection has been linked to an immunological imbalance due to deficient lymphoid organ function, including dysfunction within the thymus – a significant site of T-lymphocyte generation and development. This research studies the effects of interferon therapy on peripheral T-cell populations and thymic functions like naive-T conversion, new stem cell maturation, recent thymoramaer (RTE) production and antigen recognition activity in HCV patients. Investigated by analyzing perpheral blood mononuclear cells before and 30 days after peg IFN therapy was completed, our findings demonstrated a reduction in both circulating CD4+ count as well as RTE number following anti-HCV treatment in comparison with pretreatment levels. Furthermore, regular expression style quantitative PCR analysis suggested that these changes were accompanied by decreased mRNA transcription for several components involved in antigen recognition complexes — accumulation of which has been correlated with perturbed immune homeostatic function inside the thymus itself. The results provide evidence for altered peripheral manifestations associated with disruption of intraorgan immune dynamics when intestinal peptides are unable to be processed at therapeutic doses within this population subgroup – thus further emphasizing the importance for careful clinical observation and potential risk assessment for worsening clinical diseases across large patient cohorts being treated with such medications.",1
A large and accurate collection of peptidase cleavages in the MEROPS database,"Peptidases are enzymes that hydrolyse peptide bonds in proteins and peptides. Peptidases are important in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tumour and parasite invasion, and for processing viral polyproteins. The MEROPS database is an Internet resource containing information on peptidases, their substrates and inhibitors. The database now includes details of cleavage positions in substrates, both physiological and non-physiological, natural and synthetic. There are 39 118 cleavages in the collection; including 34 606 from a total of 10 513 different proteins and 2677 cleavages in synthetic substrates. The number of cleavages designated as ‘physiological’ is 13 307. The data are derived from 6095 publications. At least one substrate cleavage is known for 45% of the 2415 different peptidases recognized in the MEROPS database. The website now has three new displays: two showing peptidase specificity as a logo and a frequency matrix, the third showing a dynamically generated alignment between each protein substrate and its most closely related homologues. Many of the proteins described in the literature as peptidase substrates have been studied only in vitro. On the assumption that a physiologically relevant cleavage site would be conserved between species, the conservation of every site in terms of peptidase preference has been examined and a number have been identified that are not conserved. There are a number of cogent reasons why a site might not be conserved. Each poorly conserved site has been examined and a reason postulated. Some sites are identified that are very poorly conserved where cleavage is more likely to be fortuitous than of physiological relevance. This data-set is freely available via the Internet and is a useful training set for algorithms to predict substrates for peptidases and cleavage positions within those substrates. The data may also be useful for the design of inhibitors and for engineering novel specificities into peptidases. Database URL: http://merops.sanger.ac.uk",0
Interferon-Induced Ifit2/ISG54 Protects Mice from Lethal VSV Neuropathogenesis,"

This paper presents a breakthrough study on the role of interferon-induced ifit2/isg54 in protecting mice from the deadly neuroinfection caused by vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). Using a mouse model, researchers identified that pre-treatment with recombinant Interferon α significantly reduced mortality while increases were observed in Ifit2 mRNA levels as well as its derived protein. In particular, studies demonstrated that ISG54 emerged to be an important antiviral factor and further exploration revealed this was related to VSV inhibition and efficient protection against lethal infection such as encephalomyelitis. This groundbreaking research highlights the crucial involvement of ifit2/ISG 54 for successful clearance of VSV infection demonstrating its therapeutic potential for possible applications against other emerging neurologically damaging viruses.",1
Fluorescence Competition Assay Measurements of Free Energy Changes for RNA Pseudoknots,"[Image: see text] RNA pseudoknots have important functions, and thermodynamic stability is a key to predicting pseudoknots in RNA sequences and to understanding their functions. Traditional methods, such as UV melting and differential scanning calorimetry, for measuring RNA thermodynamics are restricted to temperature ranges around the melting temperature for a pseudoknot. Here, we report RNA pseudoknot free energy changes at 37 °C measured by fluorescence competition assays. Sequence-dependent studies for the loop 1−stem 2 region reveal (1) the individual nearest-neighbor hydrogen bonding (INN-HB) model provides a reasonable estimate for the free energy change when a Watson−Crick base pair in stem 2 is changed, (2) the loop entropy can be estimated by a statistical polymer model, although some penalty for certain loop sequences is necessary, and (3) tertiary interactions can significantly stabilize pseudoknots and extending the length of stem 2 may alter tertiary interactions such that the INN-HB model does not predict the net effect of adding a base pair. The results can inform writing of algorithms for predicting and/or designing RNA secondary structures.",0
Multiple lung abscesses due to acinetobacter infection: a case report,"Acinetobacter species are well-known causes of nosocomial infections. Recent increasing evidence emphasize on the role of these pathogens in community-acquired infections. We report a case of a 16-yr-old female with fever, sore throat, productive cough, malaise and the presence of lung consolidation with multiple abscesses on radiographic examination. The patient had no significant medical history. After a detailed diagnostic work-up the diagnosis of community acquired Acinetobacter pneumonia with multiple lung abscesses was made. The Acinetobacter stain was susceptible to a variety of antimicrobial agents and the patient's condition improved rapidly. A new computed tomography chest scan, three months later, confirmed full recovery. The presence of lung abscesses due to Acinetobacter infection is an extremely uncommon manifestation of the disease. This case underlines the emergent role which these, often multi-drug resistant, bacteria may play in the future, perhaps in community infections as well.",0
Synthesis and Pharmacological Evaluation of Schiff Bases of 4-(2-Aminophenyl)-Morpholines,"In the present study, a novel series of 4-(2-aminophenyl)morpholines were synthesized and characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, (13)C NMR and mass spectral analysis. The synthesized compounds were screened for analgesic (100 and 200 mg/kg), antiinflammatory (200 and 400 mg/kg), antibacterial (Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and antifungal (Candida albicans and Aspergillus niger) activities. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of the compounds were also ascertained by agar streak dilution method. N-benzylidine-2-morpholoino benzenamine (1) and N-(3-nitro benzylidine)-2-morpholino benzenamine (3) exhibited significant analgesic, antiinflammatory and antimicrobial activities.",0
Plant Plastid Engineering,"Genetic material in plants is distributed into nucleus, plastids and mitochondria. Plastid has a central role of carrying out photosynthesis in plant cells. Plastid transformation is becoming more popular and an alternative to nuclear gene transformation because of various advantages like high protein levels, the feasibility of expressing multiple proteins from polycistronic mRNAs, and gene containment through the lack of pollen transmission. Recently, much progress in plastid engineering has been made. In addition to model plant tobacco, many transplastomic crop plants have been generated which possess higher resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses and molecular pharming. In this mini review, we will discuss the features of the plastid DNA and advantages of plastid transformation. We will also present some examples of transplastomic plants developed so far through plastid engineering, and the various applications of plastid transformation.",0
Outcome of paediatric intensive care survivors,"The development of paediatric intensive care has contributed to the improved survival of critically ill children. Physical and psychological sequelae and consequences for quality of life (QoL) in survivors might be significant, as has been determined in adult intensive care unit (ICU) survivors. Awareness of sequelae due to the original illness and its treatment may result in changes in treatment and support during and after the acute phase. To determine the current knowledge on physical and psychological sequelae and the quality of life in survivors of paediatric intensive care, we undertook a computerised comprehensive search of online databases for studies reporting sequelae in survivors of paediatric intensive care. Studies reporting sequelae in paediatric survivors of cardiothoracic surgery and trauma were excluded, as were studies reporting only mortality. All other studies reporting aspects of physical and psychological sequelae were analysed. Twenty-seven studies consisting of 3,444 survivors met the selection criteria. Distinct physical and psychological sequelae in patients have been determined and seemed to interfere with quality of life. Psychological sequelae in parents seem to be common. Small numbers, methodological limitations and quantitative and qualitative heterogeneity hamper the interpretation of data. We conclude that paediatric intensive care survivors and their parents have physical and psychological sequelae affecting quality of life. Further well-designed prospective studies evaluating sequelae of the original illness and its treatment are warranted.",0
Studying plant genome variation using molecular markers,"

This study investigates the application of molecular markers to characterize and monitor plant genome variation. Molecular markers allow researchers to gain key insights into genetic diversity in plants, thus helping improve methods for breeding and conserving crop species. By studying patterns of genome variability through molecular analyses, it is possible to identify specific genotypes - such as disease resistance or drought tolerance - that offer benefits to current production systems as well as conservation efforts undertaken by public agencies and landholders. Using an established sample set obtained from field sites across a range of habitats, this research evaluated various techniques of molecular marker-based analysis with comparisons between different traits within multiple species. The results provide important new knowledge on the distribution and makeup of genomic variances in major agricultural crops, aiding future efforts for better strain selection or manipulation through biotechnological advances for improved yield management strategies.",1
Factors Affecting Intention to Receive and Self-Reported Receipt of 2009 Pandemic (H1N1) Vaccine in Hong Kong: A Longitudinal Study,"BACKGROUND: Vaccination was a core component for mitigating the 2009 influenza pandemic (pH1N1). However, a vaccination program's efficacy largely depends on population compliance. We examined general population decision-making for pH1N1 vaccination using a modified Theory of Planned Behaviour (TBP). METHODOLOGY: We conducted a longitudinal study, collecting data before and after the introduction of pH1N1 vaccine in Hong Kong. Structural equation modeling (SEM) tested if a modified TPB had explanatory utility for vaccine uptake among adults. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 896 subjects who completed both the baseline and the follow-up surveys, 7% (67/896) reported being “likely/very likely/certain” to be vaccinated (intent) but two months later only 0.8% (7/896) reported having received pH1N1 vaccination. Perception of low risk from pH1N1 (60%) and concerns regarding adverse effects of the vaccine (37%) were primary justifications for avoiding pH1N1 vaccination. Greater perceived vaccine benefits (β = 0.15), less concerns regarding vaccine side-effects (β = −0.20), greater adherence to social norms of vaccination (β = 0.39), anticipated higher regret if not vaccinated (β = 0.47), perceived higher self-efficacy for vaccination (β = 0.12) and history of seasonal influenza vaccination (β = 0.12) were associated with higher intention to receive the pH1N1 vaccine, which in turn predicted self-reported vaccination uptake (β = 0.30). Social norm (β = 0.70), anticipated regret (β = 0.19) and vaccination intention (β = 0.31) were positively associated with, and accounted for 70% of variance in vaccination planning, which, in turn subsequently predicted self-reported vaccination uptake (β = 0.36) accounting for 36% of variance in reported vaccination behaviour. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Perceived low risk from pH1N1 and perceived high risk from pH1N1 vaccine inhibited pH1N1 vaccine uptake. Both the TPB and the additional components contributed to intended vaccination uptake but social norms and anticipated regret predominantly associated with vaccination intention and planning. Vaccination planning is a more significant proximal determinant of uptake of pH1N1 vaccine than is intention. Intention alone is an unreliable predictor of future vaccine uptake.",0
A Single Immunization with Soluble Recombinant Trimeric Hemagglutinin Protects Chickens against Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza Virus H5N1,"BACKGROUND: The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus H5N1 causes multi-organ disease and death in poultry, resulting in significant economic losses in the poultry industry. In addition, it poses a major public health threat as it can be transmitted directly from infected poultry to humans with very high (60%) mortality rate. Effective vaccination against HPAI H5N1 would protect commercial poultry and would thus provide an important control measure by reducing the likelihood of bird-to-bird and bird-to-human transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In the present study we evaluated the vaccine potential of recombinant soluble trimeric subtype 5 hemagglutinin (sH5(3)) produced in mammalian cells. The secreted, purified sH5(3) was biologically active as demonstrated by its binding to ligands in a sialic acid-dependent manner. It was shown to protect chickens, in a dose-dependent manner, against a lethal challenge with H5N1 after a single vaccination. Protected animals did not shed challenge virus as determined by a quantitative RT-PCR on RNA isolated from trachea and cloaca swabs. Also in mice, vaccination with sH5(3) provided complete protection against challenge with HPAI H5N1. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results demonstrate that sH5(3) constitutes an attractive vaccine antigen for protection of chickens and mammals against HPAI H5N1. As these recombinant soluble hemagglutinin preparations can be produced with high yields and with relatively short lead time, they enable a rapid response to circulating and potentially pandemic influenza viruses.",0
Generation and Characterization of Novel Human IRAS Monoclonal Antibodies,"Imidazoline receptors were first proposed by Bousquet et al., when they studied antihypertensive effect of clonidine. A strong candidate for I1R, known as imidazoline receptor antisera-selected protein (IRAS), has been cloned from human hippocampus. We reported that IRAS mediated agmatine-induced inhibition of opioid dependence in morphine-dependent cells. To elucidate the functional and structure properties of I1R, we developed the newly monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal hIRAS region including the PX domain (10–120aa) through immunization of BALB/c mice with the NusA-IRAS fusion protein containing an IRAS N-terminal (10–120aa). Stable hybridoma cell lines were established and monoclonal antibodies specifically recognized full-length IRAS proteins in their native state by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Monoclonal antibodies stained in a predominantly punctate cytoplasmic pattern when applied to IRAS-transfected HEK293 cells by indirect immunofluorescence assays and demonstrated excellent reactivity in flow immunocytometry. These monoclonal antibodies will provide powerful reagents for the further investigation of hIRAS protein functions.",0
Regulated Ire1-dependent decay of messenger RNAs in mammalian cells,"Maintenance of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function is achieved in part through Ire1 (inositol-requiring enzyme 1), a transmembrane protein activated by protein misfolding in the ER. The cytoplasmic nuclease domain of Ire1 cleaves the messenger RNA (mRNA) encoding XBP-1 (X-box–binding protein 1), enabling splicing and production of this active transcription factor. We recently showed that Ire1 activation independently induces the rapid turnover of mRNAs encoding membrane and secreted proteins in Drosophila melanogaster cells through a pathway we call regulated Ire1-dependent decay (RIDD). In this study, we show that mouse fibroblasts expressing wild-type Ire1 but not an Ire1 variant lacking nuclease activity also degrade mRNAs in response to ER stress. Using a second variant of Ire1 that is activated by a small adenosine triphosphate analogue, we show that although XBP-1 splicing can be artificially induced in the absence of ER stress, RIDD appears to require both Ire1 activity and ER stress. Our data suggest that cells use a multitiered mechanism by which different conditions in the ER lead to distinct outputs from Ire1.",0
Competition between Influenza A Virus Genome Segments,"

Competition between Influenza A Virus Genome Segments provides deeper insight into virus transmission and pathogenesis in both human and animal populations. This study examines the competition occurring within different segments of influenza A genome, how such variation is maintained through antigenic drift among host populations, as well as its effect on viral diversity and pathogenicity. We present results from a series of laboratory experiments using in vivo mouse model to investigate which specific segment genetic variants may become dominate versus those outcompeted by other segments with different genetic architectures in hosts experiencing multiple encodings of the same genotype across multiple transmissible strain groups. The effects of genomic variation were measured under variable receptor environments involving single-molecule mutants or low-frequency changes seen during rapid evolution. Our findings suggest that for each individual infected organism the outcome of the existing competitive landscape (with respect to co-dominant or mutually exclusive encoding) will vary based upon subtle differences between infectious agents originating from distinct environmental settings within an infection cycle shaping genotype population dynamics via positive selection for competing variants over time.",1
CD8(+) T Cells in Leishmania Infections: Friends or Foes?,"

This paper investigates the complex relationship between CD8(+) T cells and Leishmania species, a vector-borne protozoan that causes leishmaniasis in humans. By reviewing existing literature, it emerging trends in the current understanding of how these cell populations interact, with implications for disease progression and treatment. A novel analysis is performed to provide insight into the role of this immunologic response in human health outcomes. The results indicate whether or not CD8(+)T cells can be considered beneficial allies in combating Leishmania infections or potential causative agents behind severe pathology. Understanding the intricate dynamics between them may pave the way for new therapeutic approaches against this devastating family of diseases.",1
Networks and the Epidemiology of Infectious Disease,"The science of networks has revolutionised research into the dynamics of interacting elements. It could be argued that epidemiology in particular has embraced the potential of network theory more than any other discipline. Here we review the growing body of research concerning the spread of infectious diseases on networks, focusing on the interplay between network theory and epidemiology. The review is split into four main sections, which examine: the types of network relevant to epidemiology; the multitude of ways these networks can be characterised; the statistical methods that can be applied to infer the epidemiological parameters on a realised network; and finally simulation and analytical methods to determine epidemic dynamics on a given network. Given the breadth of areas covered and the ever-expanding number of publications, a comprehensive review of all work is impossible. Instead, we provide a personalised overview into the areas of network epidemiology that have seen the greatest progress in recent years or have the greatest potential to provide novel insights. As such, considerable importance is placed on analytical approaches and statistical methods which are both rapidly expanding fields. Throughout this review we restrict our attention to epidemiological issues.",0
Divergent lineage of a novel hantavirus in the banana pipistrelle (Neoromicia nanus) in Côte d'Ivoire,"

This study is aimed to investigate a divergent lineage of a novel hantavirus, identified in the banana pipistrelle (Neoromicia nanus) from Côte d'Ivoire. Hantaviruses are rodent-borne viruses which cause severe respiratory diseases in humans. The emergence and prevalence of these viruses among emerging species require further investigation to understand their evolution, ecology and associated human risks. Using genetic analysis based on partial genomic sequencing of small RNA segments, this work has demonstrated that N. nanus represents an unexpected reservoir for hantaviruses related to many previously known genus species. Our results provide evidence for limited cross-species transmission and introduce a new virus into the diverse family structure of hantaviruses currently known in African bats.",1
Class II Transactivator (CIITA) Enhances Cytoplasmic Processing of HIV-1 Pr55Gag,"BACKGROUND: The Pr55(gag) (Gag) polyprotein of HIV serves as a scaffold for virion assembly and is thus essential for progeny virion budding and maturation. Gag localizes to the plasma membrane (PM) and membranes of late endosomes, allowing for release of infectious virus directly from the cell membrane and/or upon exocytosis. The host factors involved in Gag trafficking to these sites are largely unknown. Upon activation, CD4+ T cells, the primary target of HIV infection, express the class II transcriptional activator (CIITA) and therefore the MHC class II isotype, HLA-DR. Similar to Gag, HLA-DR localizes to the PM and at the membranes of endosomes and specialized vesicular MHC class II compartments (MIICs). In HIV producer cells, transient HLA-DR expression induces intracellular Gag accumulation and impairs virus release. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we demonstrate that both stable and transient expression of CIITA in HIV producer cells does not induce HLA-DR-associated intracellular retention of Gag, but does increase the infectivity of virions. However, neither of these phenomena is due to recapitulation of the class II antigen presentation pathway or CIITA-mediated transcriptional activation of virus genes. Interestingly, we demonstrate that CIITA, apart from its transcriptional effects, acts cytoplasmically to enhance Pr160(gag-pol) (Gag-Pol) levels and thereby the viral protease and Gag processing, accounting for the increased infectivity of virions from CIITA-expressing cells. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates that CIITA enhances HIV Gag processing, and provides the first evidence of a novel, post-transcriptional, cytoplasmic function for a well-known transactivator.",0

Mannosylated Lipid Nano-emulsions Loaded with Lycorine-oleic Acid Ionic Complex for Tumor Cell-specific Delivery,"

This paper introduces Mannosylated Lipid Nano-emulsions Loaded with Lycorine-oleic Acid Ionic Complex as an efficient delivery system for improved cancer targeting. As the incidence of malignant diseases increases, novel strategies to tackle tumor progression have become the focus of modern medicine. Conventional chemotherapeutic drugs, often limited by toxic effects due to broad distribution and instability, are now complemented by nanoparticles which can effectively bypass a range of physiological barriers and serve as specific carriers for therapeutic agents. In order to further enhance cellular drug loading efficiency into target cells we designed a model nanocarrier based on lycoricin-oleic acid complex loaded in mannosylated nanoemulsion complexes (MLC) and investigated its potential mechanism in cell uptake studies. The results from this study suggested that MLC could be used as a promising platform for targeted tumoral drug delivery through specific recognition among certain types of liver cancers illustrating effective overcoming of antimigratory vectors border within tumors. Thus, our findings underscore the potential application of MLCs as efficient molecular tools in medical therapy specifically related to hydrocephalus disease therapy engineering protocols with higher accuracies than other state-of-the art nanostructures.",1
The evolution of human influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006: A complete genome study,"BACKGROUND: Knowledge about the complete genome constellation of seasonal influenza A viruses from different countries is valuable for monitoring and understanding of the evolution and migration of strains. Few complete genome sequences of influenza A viruses from Europe are publicly available at the present time and there have been few longitudinal genome studies of human influenza A viruses. We have studied the evolution of circulating human H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 influenza A viruses from 1999 to 2006, we analysed 234 Danish human influenza A viruses and characterised 24 complete genomes. RESULTS: H3N2 was the prevalent strain in Denmark during the study period, but H1N1 dominated the 2000–2001 season. H1N2 viruses were first observed in Denmark in 2002–2003. After years of little genetic change in the H1N1 viruses the 2005–2006 season presented H1N1 of greater variability than before. This indicates that H1N1 viruses are evolving and that H1N1 soon is likely to be the prevalent strain again. Generally, the influenza A haemagglutinin (HA) of H3N2 viruses formed seasonal phylogenetic clusters. Different lineages co-circulating within the same season were also observed. The evolution has been stochastic, influenced by small ""jumps"" in genetic distance rather than constant drift, especially with the introduction of the Fujian-like viruses in 2002–2003. Also evolutionary stasis-periods were observed which might indicate well fit viruses. The evolution of H3N2 viruses have also been influenced by gene reassortments between lineages from different seasons. None of the influenza genes were influenced by strong positive selection pressure. The antigenic site B in H3N2 HA was the preferred site for genetic change during the study period probably because the site A has been masked by glycosylations. Substitutions at CTL-epitopes in the genes coding for the neuraminidase (NA), polymerase acidic protein (PA), matrix protein 1 (M1), non-structural protein 1 (NS1) and especially the nucleoprotein (NP) were observed. The N-linked glycosylation pattern varied during the study period and the H3N2 isolates from 2004 to 2006 were highly glycosylated with ten predicted sequons in HA, the highest amount of glycosylations observed in this study period. CONCLUSION: The present study is the first to our knowledge to characterise the evolution of complete genomes of influenza A H3N2, H1N1 and H1N2 isolates from Europe over a time period of seven years from 1999 to 2006. More precise knowledge about the circulating strains may have implications for predicting the following season strains and thereby better matching the vaccine composition.",0
"Risk of Importing Zoonotic Diseases through Wildlife Trade, United States","The United States is the world’s largest wildlife importer, and imported wild animals represent a potential source of zoonotic pathogens. Using data on mammals imported during 2000–2005, we assessed their potential to host 27 selected risk zoonoses and created a risk assessment that could inform policy making for wildlife importation and zoonotic disease surveillance. A total of 246,772 mammals in 190 genera (68 families) were imported. The most widespread agents of risk zoonoses were rabies virus (in 78 genera of mammals), Bacillus anthracis (57), Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (48), Echinococcus spp. (41), and Leptospira spp. (35). Genera capable of harboring the greatest number of risk zoonoses were Canis and Felis (14 each), Rattus (13), Equus (11), and Macaca and Lepus (10 each). These findings demonstrate the myriad opportunities for zoonotic pathogens to be imported and suggest that, to ensure public safety, immediate proactive changes are needed at multiple levels.",0
Acute Encephalopathy Associated with Influenza A Infection in Adults,"We report acute encephalopathy associated with influenza A infection in 3 adults. We detected high cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma concentrations of CXCL8/IL-8 and CCL2/MCP-1 (CSF/plasma ratios >3), and interleukin-6, CXCL10/IP-10, but no evidence of viral neuroinvasion. Patients recovered without sequelae. Hyperactivated cytokine response may play a role in pathogenesis.",0
Expression of recombinant herpes simplex virus type 2 glycoprotein D by high-density cell culture of Spodoptera frugiperda,"

This paper aims to present the outcome of a research study regarding the expression of recombinant Herpes Simplex Virus type 2 glycoprotein D by high-density cell culture from Spodoptera frugiperda, otherwise known as Fall Armyworm (FAW) cells. The goal was to conduct a comprehensive analysis and determine whether FAW can be used in recombinant protein production and what implications this holds for biotechnological development. As such, rigorous analysis into genetic mapping, biochemical testing and gene regulation involving transcription factors were carried out to investigate the performance of FAW-based transformations compared to current methods applied in industrial biotechnology processes. This provided evidence that led to insights on the economic viability and effective implementation of FAW-mediated processing pipelines while optimizing yields with improved regulatory networks.",1
"Predictors and outcome of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by miliary tuberculosis: a retrospective study in Chongqing, China","

Title: Predictors and outcome of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome caused by miliary tuberculosis: a retrospective study in Chongqing, China

The inflammatory response induced by Miliary Tuberculosis (MTb) can lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), which is associated with high mortality. In this epidemiological study we investigated the predictors and outcome of children and adults diagnosed as ARDS due to MTb in a large backyard chicken raising region of Chongqing, China. Between December 2012 - April 2018 medical records were reviewed at 120 health facilities used by 16 million residents. Based on available standard data our analysis included demographics, clinical examination from admission until discharge or death; laboratory tests revealing TB infection and X-ray images demonstrating coexisting infections such pulmonary edema/lymphadenitis damage before being released for hospital or funeral. The results indicate that middle aged male adults had a significantly increased risk for developing ARDS compared to younger individuals but women has lower mortality rate than men regardless age groupings. This report provides evidence concerning elevated morbidity rates among those affected by ARDS due to MTb under different environmental circumstances such as urban versus rural areas in Chongqing area despite differences between treatment protocols applied among healthcare providers involved in this backcrossed observational research project conducted over four years culminating also fewer cases registered during summertime months although not fully understood yet why they occurred during colder times comparing statistics gathered back then when affiliated sites submitted records prior season events taken into consideration following findings discussed I hereby concluded there was an overall trend towards better control however further investigations needed increase accuracy / improve diagnostic capacities confirm various hypothesis raised point respond adequately subsequent requests recommendations voiced remotely via feedback system implemented track response recordings consequently leading establishing sophisticated predictive models assist populationwide initiatives coping pressing issues faced eliminating potent threats public health concerns characterized unusually symptomatic post onset latency reduction reflexes indicating likely successful recovery enhanced long term stability reduce depression levels anxiety impacting all spheres society multiple interventions upscaled desired standards achieving significant improvement quality life brought forward closing off doubts pointed keeping strict surveillance policies regulatory purposes implementing regulations criminalize practices illegal acts confronting surging flu outbreaks like sources analyzed preventative measures gradually combining least cost operational course continued progress likely been noticed upon completion time frame period",1
Viral evolution and insects as a possible virologic turning table,"

The spread of infectious diseases among humans poses a continual threat to global health. The evolution of viruses and their emergence as possible pathogens have been the subject of much speculation and investigation, but little is known about how this process works on the insect scale. In this paper, we seek to explore the role of insects in viral evolution by studying various important aspects: the suppression or abundance of airborne allergens; bacterial population dynamics; environmental changes leading to new vector populations; and vast host tropism shifts in inhabitants from animals to plants. This research aims to identify which factors can contribute significantly towards shape-shifting events within virus species for better adaptation abilities which could be causing more severe pandemics with long term implications on global public health. Moreover, it explores the potential benefits associated with coevolution between plant herbivory, pollutants dispersal and transmission vectors that influence gene circulation within closely related microbial lineages while drastically modifying ecological communities locally or over larger areas. Ultimately ‘Viral Evolution and Insects as a Possible Virologic Turning Table’ identifies novel insights into insect behaviors that may explain variations over time observed in virus patterns through natural selection processes toward immunization rates reduction when transmitted by parasitoid wasps thus depicting future scenarios at macroscopic levels where efficient control strategies are needed against emerging threats posed by faster mutation cycles threatening our present day environments worldwide.",1
Filovirus Research in Gabon and Equatorial Africa: The Experience of a Research Center in the Heart of Africa,"

This article presents a review of the experience of Gabon's Centre International de Recherches Medicales (CIRMF) in filovirus research between 2006 and 2016. Located in central Equatorial Africa, CIRMF has been at the forefront of simian and human-associated viral hemorrhagic fever studies in this region during this time period. Benefits to the advancement of scientific knowledge, clinical care development and disease management are discussed as well as how economic drivers may impact future progress. Researchers from CIRMF have made several important field discoveries on transmission dynamics, virology, diagnostics instrumentation, pathogenesis and therapeutics that provide new insights for understanding filoviral infections across Central Africa. The findings will open up opportunities for collaborations among international researchers to explore further avenues towards improved filovirus control strategies worldwide by utilizing local resources available at CIRMF centre.",1
Finding and removing highly connected individuals using suboptimal vaccines,"

This paper examines the potential for using suboptimal vaccines to identify and remove highly connected individuals from a system. Suboptimal vaccine models confer partial protection against a pathogen but also grant unimmunized individuals access to paths of transmission that are difficult to detect. This could be beneficial when used on a population with high contact rates in order to decrease spread by isolating larger clusters of infective agents. Through analysis of both mathematical model simulations and real-world case studies, we explore the efficacy of this approach at mitigating disease transmission when applied at multiple scales within a susceptible populace structure. We conclude by discussing strategies for implementing similar applications, emphasizing the need for careful evaluation before widespread use. The findings suggest promising opportunities in achieving timely identification and removal of highly connected persons as part of an effective public health intervention strategy during exceptional epidemiological conditions or outbreaks.",1
A Novel Peptide Enhances Therapeutic Efficacy of Liposomal Anti-Cancer Drugs in Mice Models of Human Lung Cancer,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. The lack of tumor specificity remains a major drawback for effective chemotherapies and results in dose-limiting toxicities. However, a ligand-mediated drug delivery system should be able to render chemotherapy more specific to tumor cells and less toxic to normal tissues. In this study, we isolated a novel peptide ligand from a phage-displayed peptide library that bound to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines. The targeting phage bound to several NSCLC cell lines but not to normal cells. Both the targeting phage and the synthetic peptide recognized the surgical specimens of NSCLC with a positive rate of 75% (27 of 36 specimens). In severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice bearing NSCLC xenografts, the targeting phage specifically bound to tumor masses. The tumor homing ability of the targeting phage was inhibited by the cognate synthetic peptide, but not by a control or a WTY-mutated peptide. When the targeting peptide was coupled to liposomes carrying doxorubicin or vinorelbine, the therapeutic index of the chemotherapeutic agents and the survival rates of mice with human lung cancer xenografts markedly increased. Furthermore, the targeting liposomes increased drug accumulation in tumor tissues by 5.7-fold compared with free drugs and enhanced cancer cell apoptosis resulting from a higher concentration of bioavailable doxorubicin. The current study suggests that this tumor-specific peptide may be used to create chemotherapies specifically targeting tumor cells in the treatment of NSCLC and to design targeted gene transfer vectors or it may be used one in the diagnosis of this malignancy.",0
Detection of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) using isothermal amplification of target DNA sequences,"BACKGROUND: The most common method of GMO detection is based upon the amplification of GMO-specific DNA amplicons using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Here we have applied the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method to amplify GMO-related DNA sequences, 'internal' commonly-used motifs for controlling transgene expression and event-specific (plant-transgene) junctions. RESULTS: We have tested the specificity and sensitivity of the technique for use in GMO studies. Results show that detection of 0.01% GMO in equivalent background DNA was possible and dilutions of template suggest that detection from single copies of the template may be possible using LAMP. CONCLUSION: This work shows that GMO detection can be carried out using LAMP for routine screening as well as for specific events detection. Moreover, the sensitivity and ability to amplify targets, even with a high background of DNA, here demonstrated, highlights the advantages of this isothermal amplification when applied for GMO detection.",0
Evolutionary Entropy Determines Invasion Success in Emergent Epidemics,"BACKGROUND: Standard epidemiological theory claims that in structured populations competition between multiple pathogen strains is a deterministic process which is mediated by the basic reproduction number ([Image: see text]) of the individual strains. A new theory based on analysis, simulation and empirical study challenges this predictor of success. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We show that the quantity [Image: see text] is a valid predictor in structured populations only when size is infinite. In this article we show that when population size is finite the dynamics of infection by multi-strain pathogens is a stochastic process whose outcome can be predicted by evolutionary entropy, S, an information theoretic measure which describes the uncertainty in the infectious age of an infected parent of a randomly chosen new infective. Evolutionary entropy characterises the demographic stability or robustness of the population of infectives. This statistical parameter determines the duration of infection and thus provides a quantitative index of the pathogenicity of a strain. Standard epidemiological theory based on [Image: see text] as a measure of selective advantage is the limit as the population size tends to infinity of the entropic selection theory. The standard model is an approximation to the entropic selection theory whose validity increases with population size. CONCLUSION: An epidemiological analysis based on entropy is shown to explain empirical observations regarding the emergence of less pathogenic strains of human influenza during the antigenic drift phase. Furthermore, we exploit the entropy perspective to discuss certain epidemiological patterns of the current H1N1 swine 'flu outbreak.",0
"Triple Combination of Amantadine, Ribavirin, and Oseltamivir Is Highly Active and Synergistic against Drug Resistant Influenza Virus Strains In Vitro","The rapid emergence and subsequent spread of the novel 2009 Influenza A/H1N1 virus (2009 H1N1) has prompted the World Health Organization to declare the first pandemic of the 21(st) century, highlighting the threat of influenza to public health and healthcare systems. Widespread resistance to both classes of influenza antivirals (adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors) occurs in both pandemic and seasonal viruses, rendering these drugs to be of marginal utility in the treatment modality. Worldwide, virtually all 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 strains are resistant to the adamantanes (rimantadine and amantadine), and the majority of seasonal H1N1 strains are resistant to oseltamivir, the most widely prescribed neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI). To address the need for more effective therapy, we evaluated the in vitro activity of a triple combination antiviral drug (TCAD) regimen composed of drugs with different mechanisms of action against drug-resistant seasonal and 2009 H1N1 influenza viruses. Amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir, alone and in combination, were tested against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant influenza A viruses using an in vitro infection model in MDCK cells. Our data show that the triple combination was highly synergistic against drug-resistant viruses, and the synergy of the triple combination was significantly greater than the synergy of any double combination tested (P<0.05), including the combination of two NAIs. Surprisingly, amantadine and oseltamivir contributed to the antiviral activity of the TCAD regimen against amantadine- and oseltamivir-resistant viruses, respectively, at concentrations where they had no activity as single agents, and at concentrations that were clinically achievable. Our data demonstrate that the TCAD regimen composed of amantadine, ribavirin, and oseltamivir is highly synergistic against resistant viruses, including 2009 H1N1. The TCAD regimen overcomes baseline drug resistance to both classes of approved influenza antivirals, and thus may represent a highly active antiviral therapy for seasonal and pandemic influenza.",0
Chinese journals: a guide for epidemiologists,"Chinese journals in epidemiology, preventive medicine and public health contain much that is of potential international interest. However, few non-Chinese speakers are acquainted with this literature. This article therefore provides an overview of the contemporary scene in Chinese biomedical journal publication, Chinese bibliographic databases and Chinese journals in epidemiology, preventive medicine and public health. The challenge of switching to English as the medium of publication, the development of publishing bibliometric data from Chinese databases, the prospect of an Open Access publication model in China, the issue of language bias in literature reviews and the quality of Chinese journals are discussed. Epidemiologists are encouraged to search the Chinese bibliographic databases for Chinese journal articles.",0
Effects of a Non-Conservative Sequence on the Properties of β-glucuronidase from Aspergillus terreus Li-20,"

This article examines the Effects of a Non-Conservative Sequence on the Properties of β-glucuronidase from Aspergillus terreus Li-20. Activity levels and basic biochemical features were studied in order to understand how alterations in amino acid makeup could affect protein performance. We compared an existing conservative sequence to one with numerous non conservative substitutions, determining that although some characteristics are altered by specific manipulations, overall function is not significantly changed. Findings suggest that certain structural elements retain consistent behavior despite changes in sequences and reaffirm current knowledge related to this enzyme family's functional flexibility when faced with frame shifts or insertions/deletions. Results will have implications for biotechnological applications demanding large scale production and optimization strategies needing resilience against environmental stresses such as temperature variation and nutrient deficiency.",1
"Bench-to-bedside review: Critical illness-associated cognitive dysfunction – mechanisms, markers, and emerging therapeutics","Cognitive dysfunction is common in critically ill patients, not only during the acute illness but also long after its resolution. A large number of pathophysiologic mechanisms are thought to underlie critical illness-associated cognitive dysfunction, including neuro-transmitter abnormalities and occult diffuse brain injury. Markers that could be used to evaluate the influence of specific mechanisms in individual patients include serum anticholinergic activity, certain brain proteins, and tissue sodium concentration determination via high-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. Although recent therapeutic advances in this area are exciting, they are still too immature to influence patient care. Additional research is needed if we are to understand better the relative contributions of specific mechanisms to the development of critical illness-associated cognitive dysfunction and to determine whether these mechanisms might be amenable to treatment or prevention.",0
Factors affecting translation at the programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting site of Cocksfoot mottle virus RNA in vivo,"The ratio between proteins P27 and replicase of Cocksfoot mottle virus (CfMV) is regulated via a −1 programmed ribosomal frameshift (−1 PRF). A minimal frameshift signal with a slippery U UUA AAC heptamer and a downstream stem–loop structure was inserted into a dual reporter vector and directed −1 PRF with an efficiency of 14.4 ± 1.9% in yeast and 2.4 ± 0.7% in bacteria. P27-encoding CfMV sequence flanking the minimal frameshift signal caused ∼2-fold increase in the −1 PRF efficiencies both in yeast and in bacteria. In addition to the expected fusion proteins, termination products ending putatively at the frameshift site were found in yeast cells. We propose that the amount of premature translation termination from control mRNAs played a role in determining the calculated −1PRF efficiency. Co-expression of CfMV P27 with the dual reporter vector containing the minimal frameshift signal reduced the production of the downstream reporter, whereas replicase co-expression had no pronounced effect. This finding allows us to propose that CfMV protein P27 may influence translation at the frameshift site but the mechanism needs to be elucidated.",0
Critical care services and the H1N1 (2009) influenza epidemic in Australia and New Zealand in 2010: the impact of the second winter epidemic,"

This article critically explores Critical Care Services and their response to the H1N1 (2009) influenza epidemic in Australia and New Zealand in 2010. The analysis explores three crucial approaches: a comprehensive epidemiological profile of the region, an assessment of organizational capacity for pandemic preparedness, and an appraisal of health system performance during this second-wave winter epidemic. This paper represents a unique analytical exercise combining both primary qualitative data generated from interviews with health professionals and secondary quantitative data extracted from national reports by public health organizations. Overall, findings suggest that collaborative efforts between state governments, local representatives, nongovernmental organizations such as hospitals and community agencies improved capabilities to respond rapidly towards detection, containment strategies and care coordination associated with controlling further spread of the virus throughout Australian-New Zealand communities. The implications these results offer address important knowledge gaps regarding regional response mechanisms towards communicable outbreaks.",1
IL-15 Participates in the Respiratory Innate Immune Response to Influenza Virus Infection,"

This study presents novel evidence that the cytokine Interleukin-15 (IL-15) contributes to the respiratory innate immune response against influenza virus infection. IL-15 is heavily expressed in lungs during infection and plays an essential role in regulating inflammatory responses, playing a direct or indirect part in production of antiviral proteins such as type 1 interferons and Th1 cells for activation of specific surveillance mechanisms. As a result, mice deficient in IL-15 showed increased susceptibility to Influenza A Virus H3N2 compared with wildtype mice following intranasal inoculation. Moreover, further insights into pathogenic differences between wildtype and IL-15 deficient mice showed stronger infiltration of neutrophils, resulting from enhanced chemokines expression levels associated with higher viral titer demonstrated by real time RT PCR detection assays. Taken together these data imply a co-regulatory mechanism by which IL-15 protects against influenza virus infections more robustly than each mechanism separately.",1
Evaluation of Internal Reference Genes for Quantitative Expression Analysis by Real-Time PCR in Ovine Whole Blood,"

This study explores the suitability of 14 internal reference genes for quantitative expression analysis by Real-Time PCR in ovine whole blood. Global livestock production is a major source of dairy and meat products, with sheep representing one of the leading animal species raised worldwide. To better improve livestock husbandry practices and optimize resource management, it is necessary to understand gene expression regulation in order to gain insights into the physiological state and response to environmental impacts observed in different breeds or conditions. In this context, this research offers systematic evaluation of candidate internal reference genes from ovine whole blood using comparative ΔΔCq methodology. Results will allow determining optimal combinations for use as references when monitoring gene expression fluctuations during experiments with these animals under study. The findings can also help direct further investigations on gene regulations associated with health maintenance programs such genetic markers used for selection strategies applied in sheep breeding schemes.",1
What was the primary mode of smallpox transmission? Implications for biodefense,"

This paper will explore the primary mode of smallpox transmission and discuss its implications for biodefense. Smallpox is a contagious infectious disease caused by two variola virus strains, which destroy skin cells and cause a characteristic rash on the surface of the body. Due to successful global eradication strategies that began in 1967, it became declared globally extinct in 1980; however, concerns remain about its potential use as a bioweapon or accidental reemergence through research laboratories. To understand prevention efforts better and to plan ahead against possible outbreaks, this article will investigate evidence on how smallpox is transmitted and what precautions should be taken regarding vaccination programs, safe handling procedures of biological material, and containment protocols. The findings from this study can inform public health policy decisions related to smallpox prevention measures worldwide and offer valuable insights into enhancing existing bio-defense capabilities against intentional spread of this dangerous virus organism .",1
A review on chemical and biological properties of Cayratia trifolia Linn. (Vitaceae),"

This paper presents a systematic review of the chemical and biological properties of Cayratia trifolia Linn., commonly known as ‘Three-Leaved Creeper’ (Vitaceae). This plant is widely distributed across parts of Asia, India and China and has been used for centuries in traditional folk medicine. The paper analyses the compound constituents isolated from C. trifolia with an emphasis on their protein structure, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant activities and cytotoxicity potentials that had been previously verified by other chemists or clinicians. The pharmacological advantages derived from C. trifolia are discussed along with its possible applications as a functional food product for restoring health conditions due to illnesses like respiratory ailments, intestinal discomfort or urinary issues among others upon identifying stabilizing agents within this species that could counter possible toxicity effects caused by volatile components found in some common plants belonging to this family. Various studies have reported positive outcomes but further research is needed so to expand knowledge regarding the peculiarities included in the active metabolites present in  C. trifolia that may eventually lead to clinical breakthroughs in treating various human afflictions or virulent infections using reliable natural substances available at no additional cost than sheer effort work applied during harvesting regimes..",1
Mathematical Analysis of Copy Number Variation in a DNA Sample Using Digital PCR on a Nanofluidic Device,"Copy Number Variations (CNVs) of regions of the human genome have been associated with multiple diseases. We present an algorithm which is mathematically sound and computationally efficient to accurately analyze CNV in a DNA sample utilizing a nanofluidic device, known as the digital array. This numerical algorithm is utilized to compute copy number variation and the associated statistical confidence interval and is based on results from probability theory and statistics. We also provide formulas which can be used as close approximations.",0
Codetection of Respiratory Syncytial Virus in Habituated Wild Western Lowland Gorillas and Humans During a Respiratory Disease Outbreak,"

This study examines the codetection of Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in habituated wild western lowland gorillas and humans during a respiratory disease outbreak. During September and October 2018, an RSV-like infection affected both human residents at Mbeli Bai, Republic of Congo and three of 19 habituated western lowland gorillas living in this walant tendu forest fragment. Here we report on virological evidence from tracheal swabs collected from both species. This novel investigation reveals that similar residues caused the infection in all individuals and suggests a potential cross-species transmission event between humans and gorillas sharing a common habitat structure, which could have potentially increased risk to transmitted infections. The findings generated by this study underscore the importance of monitoring emerging infectious diseases among apes inhabiting areas with consistent human contact.",1
Assessing the In Vitro Fitness of an Oseltamivir-Resistant Seasonal A/H1N1 Influenza Strain Using a Mathematical Model,"In 2007, the A/Brisbane/59/2007 (H1N1) seasonal influenza virus strain acquired the oseltamivir-resistance mutation H275Y in its neuraminidase (NA) gene. Although previous studies had demonstrated that this mutation impaired the replication capacity of the influenza virus in vitro and in vivo, the A/Brisbane/59/2007 H275Y oseltamivir-resistant mutant completely out-competed the wild-type (WT) strain and was, in the 2008–2009 influenza season, the primary A/H1N1 circulating strain. Using a combination of plaque and viral yield assays, and a simple mathematical model, approximate values were extracted for two basic viral kinetics parameters of the in vitro infection. In the ST6GalI-MDCK cell line, the latent infection period (i.e., the time for a newly infected cell to start releasing virions) was found to be 1–3 h for the WT strain and more than 7 h for the H275Y mutant. The infecting time (i.e., the time for a single infectious cell to cause the infection of another one) was between 30 and 80 min for the WT, and less than 5 min for the H275Y mutant. Single-cycle viral yield experiments have provided qualitative confirmation of these findings. These results, though preliminary, suggest that the increased fitness success of the A/Brisbane/59/2007 H275Y mutant may be due to increased infectivity compensating for an impaired or delayed viral release, and are consistent with recent evidence for the mechanistic origins of fitness reduction and recovery in NA expression. The method applied here can reconcile seemingly contradictory results from the plaque and yield assays as two complementary views of replication kinetics, with both required to fully capture a strain's fitness.",0
"Toxicology, biodistribution and shedding profile of a recombinant measles vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 antigens, in cynomolgus macaques"," 

This study entitled ‘Toxicology, biodistribution and shedding profile of a recombinant measles vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 antigens, in cynomolgus macaques’ explores the interaction between wild type measles viruses (MV) and chimeric MVs expressing HIV-1 Env gp140. The research addresses an urgent global health concern - current treatments for AIDS are only able to sustain long term remission; there are no vaccines offering complete protection against HIV. This research aims to inform preclinical development of MV vectors designed as potential therapeutic agents by investigating their toxicology, biodistribution and shedding profiles. Cynomolgus macaques were chosen as a nonhuman primate model due to their immunological similarity with humans, which permits extrapolation towards efficacy testing in human clinical trials. Our results indicate that the test vector delivered efficient functional Env protein expression without significant detrimental effects on health or longevity in these animals over 1 year post inoculation (p.i.). These findings may serve as essential information for developing future prophylactic MV based constructs proposed for AIDS therapy, providing promising grounds for advanced stepwise tests through safety/efficacy evaluation approaches validating this class of novel vaccination vectors exemplified herein.",1
MIMOX: a web tool for phage display based epitope mapping,"BACKGROUND: Phage display is widely used in basic research such as the exploration of protein-protein interaction sites and networks, and applied research such as the development of new drugs, vaccines, and diagnostics. It has also become a promising method for epitope mapping. Research on new algorithms that assist and automate phage display based epitope mapping has attracted many groups. Most of the existing tools have not been implemented as an online service until now however, making it less convenient for the community to access, utilize, and evaluate them. RESULTS: We present MIMOX, a free web tool that helps to map the native epitope of an antibody based on one or more user supplied mimotopes and the antigen structure. MIMOX was coded in Perl using modules from the Bioperl project. It has two sections. In the first section, MIMOX provides a simple interface for ClustalW to align a set of mimotopes. It also provides a simple statistical method to derive the consensus sequence and embeds JalView as a Java applet to view and manage the alignment. In the second section, MIMOX can map a single mimotope or a consensus sequence of a set of mimotopes, on to the corresponding antigen structure and search for all of the clusters of residues that could represent the native epitope. NACCESS is used to evaluate the surface accessibility of the candidate clusters; and Jmol is embedded to view them interactively in their 3D context. Initial case studies show that MIMOX can reproduce mappings from existing tools such as FINDMAP and 3DEX, as well as providing novel, rational results. CONCLUSION: A web-based tool called MIMOX has been developed for phage display based epitope mapping. As a publicly available online service in this area, it is convenient for the community to access, utilize, and evaluate, complementing other existing programs. MIMOX is freely available at .",0
Functional Analysis of the 5′ Genomic Sequence of a Bovine Norovirus,"BACKGROUND: Jena Virus (JV), a bovine Norovirus, causes enteric disease in cattle and represents a potential model for the study of enteric norovirus infection and pathogenesis. The positive sense RNA genome of JV is organised into ORF1 (non-structural proteins), ORF2 (major capsid protein) and ORF3 (minor capsid protein). The lack of a cell culture system for studying JV replication has meant that work to date has relied upon in vitro systems to study non-structural protein synthesis and processing. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Only two of the three major ORF1 proteins were identified (p110 and 2C) following in vitro translation of JV RNA, the N-term protein was not detected. The N-term encoding genomic sequence (5′GS) was tested for IRES-like function in a bi-cistronic system and displayed no evidence of IRES-like activity. The site of translation initiation in JV was determined to be at the predicted nucleotide 22. Following the insertion of an epitope within the 5′GS the JV N-term protein was identified in vitro and within RNA transfected cells. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro transcription/translation system is currently the best system for analysing protein synthesis and processing in JV. Unlike similarly studied human noroviruses JV initially did not appear to express the N-terminal protein, presenting the possibility that the encoding RNA sequence had a regulatory function, most likely involved in translation initiation in an IRES-like manner. This was not the case and, following determination of the site of translation initiation the N-term protein was detected using an epitope tag, both in vitro and in vivo. Although slightly larger than predicted the N-term protein was detected in a processed form in vivo, thus not only demonstrating initial translation of the ORF1 polyprotein but also activity of the viral protease. These findings indicate that the block to noroviral replication in cultured cells lies elsewhere.",0
An improved ELISA for the detection of antibodies againstBabesia bovis using either a native or a recombinantB. bovis antigen,"

An improved ELISA for the detection of antibodies against Babesia bovis using either a native or a recombinant B. bovis antigen has been tailored to provide more efficient serological diagnosis. This study provides an insight into the development and validation of two novel Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) techniques which detect Babesia bovis- specific IgG in cattle serum samples. Results demonstrate high specificity and sensitivity for both techniques, reshaping traditional approaches to detecting immune response against this intracellular parasite infection, as well as providing better understanding of its biology and epidemic potential in livestock.",1
Fas-deficient mice have impaired alveolar neutrophil recruitment and decreased expression of anti-KC autoantibody:KC complexes in a model of acute lung injury,"

This study investigates the changes in immune balance after Fas-deficient mice were exposed to a model of acute lung injury. Our findings suggest that F–/-- mice have impaired alveolar neutrophil recruitment and reduced autoantibody expression, indicating an altered response to natural killer cell inhibition pathways and defective proinflammatory signaling is crucial for effective anti-inflammatory host defense mechanisms. This disruption compromises both the innate and adaptive arms of immune surveillance, likely due to differences in small molecule pathway regulation between wildtype (WT) and deficient mouse models. Additionally, we show increased macrophage infiltration within unaffected areas as well as decreased expression of pathogen specific IgG1 & B3 antibodies compared with WT counterparts. Taken together our results demonstrate significant impairments in neutrophil recruitment associate dwith disrupted killing capacity against susceptible bacteria which may play a role in disease progression upon infection or inflammation.",1
"The Impact of Weather on Influenza and Pneumonia Mortality in New York City, 1975–2002: A Retrospective Study","

This paper presents a retrospective study conducted to assess the impact of meteorological factors on influenza and pneumonia mortality in New York City between 1975 and 2002. By analyzing existing data, this research investigates how monthly average temperatures, precipitation levels as well as snowfall totals can influence disease-related death rates. Additionally, it examines temporal patterns of deaths due to Influenza and Pneumonia during cold winter months versus warmer summer periods from 1975 through 2002 using various statistical measures such as correlation analysis. The results illustrate that weather has an important role in determining yearly mortality rate from seasonal flu epidemics although the magnitude of its impact varies greatly over time. This comprehensive investigation provides valuable insight for policy makers into understanding decisions made about public health interventions against infectious diseases which are strongly affected by climate variation throughout their lifecycle in order to provide better preventive healthcare against years exhibiting exceptional climatic conditions.",1
"HIV-related restrictions on entry, residence and stay in the WHO European Region: a survey","BACKGROUND: Back in 1987, the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that the screening of international travellers was an ineffective way to prevent the spread of HIV. However, some countries still restrict the entrance and/or residency of foreigners with an HIV infection. HIV-related travel restrictions have serious implications for individual and public health, and violate internationally recognized human rights. In this study, we reviewed the current situation regarding HIV-related travel restrictions in the 53 countries of the WHO European Region. METHODS: We retrieved the country-specific information chiefly from the Global Database on HIV Related Travel Restrictions at hivtravel.org. We simplified and standardized the database information to enable us to create an overview and compare countries. Where data was outdated, unclear or contradictory, we contacted WHO HIV focal points in the countries or appropriate non-governmental organizations. The United States Bureau of Consular Affairs website was also used to confirm and complement these data. RESULTS: Our review revealed that there are no entry restrictions for people living with HIV in 51 countries in the WHO European Region. In 11 countries, foreigners living with HIV applying for long-term stays will not be granted a visa. These countries are: Andorra, Armenia, Cyprus (denies access for non-European Union citizens), Hungary, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan. In Uzbekistan, an HIV-positive foreigner cannot even enter the country, and in Georgia, we were not able to determine whether there were any HIV-related travel restrictions due to a lack of information. CONCLUSIONS: In 32% of the countries in the European Region, either there are some kind of HIV-related travel restrictions or we were unable to determine if such restrictions are in force. Most of these countries defend restrictions as being justified by public health concerns. However, there is no evidence that denying HIV-positive foreigners access to a country is effective in protecting public health. Governments should revise legislation on HIV-related travel restrictions. In the meantime, a joint effort is needed to draw attention to the continuing discrimination and stigmatization of people living with HIV that takes place in those European Region countries where such laws and policies are still in force.",0
Community responses to communication campaigns for influenza A (H1N1): a focus group study,"

'Community responses to communication campaigns for influenza A (H1N1): a focus group study' 
This article presents the findings of a qualitative investigation into community responses to communication campaigns related to H1N1. An exploratory mixed methodology design was carried out with six focus groups conducted in three metropolitan areas located in the United States. The aim of the research was to examine how communities perceive and react to public health communication strategies about seasonal influenza and prevention efforts for H1N1 specifically, as well as their opinions on how these messages can be improved upon. Results from this cross-sectional analysis suggest that effectiveness and impact of such communications may improve through customizing content based on factors such as cultural/ethnic identity or stage of illness, developing tailored educational programs across different age groups, utilizing existing infrastructures or media sources close by participants’ own social networks, taking into account timing preferences throughout various stages of an outbreak trajectory, delivering clear guidelines regarding protective measures without creating unnecessary panic and fear among potential audiences. Findings are further discussed with philosophy and practices translated into recommendations.'",1
Rooting human parechovirus evolution in time,"BACKGROUND: The Picornaviridae family contains a number of important pathogenic viruses, among which the recently reclassified human parechoviruses (HPeVs). These viruses are widespread and can be grouped in several types. Understanding the evolutionary history of HPeV could answer questions such as how long the circulating lineages last shared a common ancestor and how the evolution of this viral species is shaped by its population dynamics. Using both strict and relaxed clock Bayesian phylogenetics we investigated 1) the substitutions rates of the structural P1 and capsid VP1 regions and 2) evolutionary timescale of currently circulating HPeV lineages. RESULTS: Our estimates reveal that human parechoviruses exhibit high substitution rates for both structural P1 and capsid VP1 regions, respectively 2.21 × 10(-3 )(0.48 – 4.21 × 10(-3)) and 2.79 × 10(-3 )(2.05 – 3.66 × 10(-3)) substitutions per site per year. These are within the range estimated for other picornaviruses. By employing a constant population size coalescent prior, the date of the most recent common ancestor was estimated to be at around 1600 (1427–1733). In addition, by looking at the frequency of synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions within the VP1 gene we show that purifying selection constitutes the dominating evolutionary force leading to strong amino acid conservation. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, our estimates provide a timescale for the evolution of HPeVs and suggest that genetic diversity of current circulating HPeV types has arisen about 400 years ago.",0
Extended expression of B-class MADS-box genes in the paleoherb Asarum caudigerum," 

This paper reports the extended expression of MADS-box genes, key regulators in plant development, in a paleoherb during early bloom. Results illustrate increased transcript abundance that positively correlates with flower sepal and petal number up to budding stage, as well as with carpel formation. Transcriptome data was obtained from ten diverse accessions of Asarum caudigerum subsp. parviflora alongside three control species utilizing RNAseq technique and publicly available databases were used for further analysis. The findings highlight an expressions pattern variation between studied samples and suggest a prospective contribution of the B-class MADS-box genes to morphological changes throughout Aparviflora blooming process. Our work provides a meaningful insight into nuclear mechanisms underlying flower development applicable to other phylogenetically related taxa derived from this lineage.",1
Directed Fusion of Mesenchymal Stem Cells with Cardiomyocytes via VSV-G Facilitates Stem Cell Programming,"

This paper investigates the directed fusion of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with cardiomyocytes via viral-surface glycoprotein G of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G), and explores its potential for programming MSCs. Around two decades ago, these multipotent MSCs were discovered in several organs which raised great hopes regarding their regenerative capabilities when programmed to become functional cell types. Studies have shown that VSV-G facilitates efficient and highly specific fusion due to its ability to interact with different types of membranes directly, resulting in an improved cellular reprogramming outcome compared with chemical or electrical methods. This study is aimed at defining the optimal parameters affecting final product achievement such as concentration, incubation time and temperature range during this process. By way of doing so, a better understanding is expected on how to harness stem cell plasticity by means of facilitating appropriate genetic switching events through induced membrane contact sites between partner cells thanks to VSV-G mediated elements fusions.",1
"Let the sun shine in: effects of ultraviolet radiation on invasive pneumococcal disease risk in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania","BACKGROUND: Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common cause of community acquired pneumonia and bacteremia. Excess wintertime mortality related to pneumonia has been noted for over a century, but the seasonality of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) has been described relatively recently and is poorly understood. Improved understanding of environmental influence on disease seasonality has taken on new urgency due to global climate change. METHODS: We evaluated 602 cases of IPD reported in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania, from 2002 to 2007. Poisson regression models incorporating seasonal smoothers were used to identify associations between weekly weather patterns and case counts. Associations between acute (day-to-day) environmental fluctuations and IPD occurrence were evaluated using a case-crossover approach. Effect modification across age and sex strata was explored, and meta-regression models were created using stratum-specific estimates for effect. RESULTS: IPD incidence was greatest in the wintertime, and spectral decomposition revealed a peak at 51.0 weeks, consistent with annual periodicity. After adjustment for seasonality, yearly increases in reporting, and temperature, weekly incidence was found to be associated with clear-sky UV index (IRR per unit increase in index: 0.70 [95% CI 0.54-0.91]). The effect of UV index was highest among young strata and decreased with age. At shorter time scales, only an association with increases in ambient sulphur oxides was linked to disease risk (OR for highest tertile of exposure 0.75, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93). CONCLUSION: We confirmed the wintertime predominance of IPD in a major urban center. The major predictor of IPD in Philadelphia is extended periods of low UV radiation, which may explain observed wintertime seasonality. The mechanism of action of diminished light exposure on disease occurrence may be due to direct effects on pathogen survival or host immune function via altered 1,25-(OH)(2)-vitamin-D metabolism. These findings may suggest less diminution in future IPD risk with climate change than would be expected if wintertime seasonality was driven by temperature.",0
"Ipomoelin, a Jacalin-Related Lectin with a Compact Tetrameric Association and Versatile Carbohydrate Binding Properties Regulated by Its N Terminus","

This paper explores the unique and complex carbohydrate binding properties of ipomoelin, a jacalin-related lectin with an unexpectedly compact tetrameric association. This extensively studied model protein is capable of recognizing a wide range of carbohydrates, yet its specific binding features are regulated by the spacing between two structural domains – namely its N terminus and carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD). Through extensive molecular studies, our work demonstrates how multiple structural motifs interact to modulate affinity for critical natural sugars. Additionally, we introduce an in silico platform based on these findings to aid further study and potentially increase the utility of this essential pathogenic glycoprotein in experimental settings. Our results thus broaden current understanding of lectin-based glycobiology while offering guidance on effective methods for engineering or exploiting ipomoelin ligand interactions as part of diagnostics and drug design efforts.",1
Structural aspects of antibody-antigen interaction revealed through small random peptide libraries,"

This study focuses on elucidating the structural characteristics of antibody-antigen (Ab–Ag) interactions and their relationship to affinity using small random peptide libraries. The intricate specificity with which antibodies recognize antigens is an essential basis for the development of therapeutics, diagnostics and vaccines against pathogenic infections. However, insight into molecular mechanisms of Ab–Ag recognition has been limited by a lack of comprehensive data on these interactions at an atomic level. Here, we describe how receptor-ligand bond formation was explored using qualitative fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), as implemented through two random 15-mer peptide libraries composed from amino acids found in each antigen molecule’s epitope site. Our results indicate that short FRET treatments can effectively distinguish high affinity interacting pairs over low ones for Ab–Ag complexes ranged between pIC50 9–11 classes depending on differences in steric size between each partner set pairings. Taken together, our findings provide new information about the structural aspects pertinent to effective Ab–Ag recognition, making significant contributions to immunotherapeutic approaches targeting pathogen disruption by harnessing naturally occurring host defenses against infection.",1
Markers of exacerbation severity in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"BACKGROUND: Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can experience 'exacerbations' of their conditions. An exacerbation is an event defined in terms of subjective descriptors or symptoms, namely dyspnoea, cough and sputum that worsen sufficiently to warrant a change in medical management. There is a need for reliable markers that reflect the pathological mechanisms that underlie exacerbation severity and that can be used as a surrogate to assess treatment effects in clinical studies. Little is known as to how existing study variables and suggested markers change in both the stable and exacerbation phases of COPD. In an attempt to find the best surrogates for exacerbations, we have reviewed the literature to identify which of these markers change in a consistent manner with the severity of the exacerbation event. METHODS: We have searched standard databases between 1966 to July 2004 using major keywords and terms. Studies that provided demographics, spirometry, potential markers, and clear eligibility criteria were included in this study. Central tendencies and dispersions for all the variables and markers reported and collected by us were first tabulated according to sample size and ATS/ERS 2004 Exacerbation Severity Levels I to III criteria. Due to the possible similarity of patients in Levels II and III, the data was also redefined into categories of exacerbations, namely out-patient (Level I) and in-patient (Levels II & III combined). For both approaches, we performed a fixed effect meta-analysis on each of the reported variables. RESULTS: We included a total of 268 studies reported between 1979 to July 2004. These studies investigated 142,407 patients with COPD. Arterial carbon dioxide tension and breathing rate were statistically different between all levels of exacerbation severity and between in out- and in-patient settings. Most other measures showed weak relationships with either level or setting, or they had insufficient data to permit meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: Arterial carbon dioxide and breathing rate varied in a consistent manner with exacerbation severity and patient setting. Many other measures showed weak correlations that should be further explored in future longitudinal studies or assessed using suggested mathematical modelling techniques.",0
Detection of Bocavirus in Children Suffering from Acute Respiratory Tract Infections in Saudi Arabia,"

This paper presents a study of the detection of Bocavirus in children suffering from acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) within Saudi Arabia. The prevalence and genetic diversity of airborne Bocaviruses associated with ARIs among paediatric patients attending hospitals within Saudi Arabia were investigated to better understand the impact of these viruses on public health. Using real-time PCR, samples collected from participants were tested for seven known strains with confirmatory sequencing being conducted when necessary. Results showed that total detection rate was 14%, with two new genotypes identified; This provides evidence supporting the role these viruses play as one of many infectious agents impacting human health in this region. Implications relating to prophylactic measures and future research around airborn viral pathogens will be discussed.",1
Surfactant protein-D and pulmonary host defense,"Surfactant protein-D (SP-D) participates in the innate response to inhaled microorganisms and organic antigens, and contributes to immune and inflammatory regulation within the lung. SP-D is synthesized and secreted by alveolar and bronchiolar epithelial cells, but is also expressed by epithelial cells lining various exocrine ducts and the mucosa of the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts. SP-D, a collagenous calcium-dependent lectin (or collectin), binds to surface glycoconjugates expressed by a wide variety of microorganisms, and to oligosaccharides associated with the surface of various complex organic antigens. SP-D also specifically interacts with glycoconjugates and other molecules expressed on the surface of macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. In addition, SP-D binds to specific surfactant-associated lipids and can influence the organization of lipid mixtures containing phosphatidylinositol in vitro. Consistent with these diverse in vitro activities is the observation that SP-D-deficient transgenic mice show abnormal accumulations of surfactant lipids, and respond abnormally to challenge with respiratory viruses and bacterial lipopolysaccharides. The phenotype of macrophages isolated from the lungs of SP-D-deficient mice is altered, and there is circumstantial evidence that abnormal oxidant metabolism and/or increased metalloproteinase expression contributes to the development of emphysema. The expression of SP-D is increased in response to many forms of lung injury, and deficient accumulation of appropriately oligomerized SP-D might contribute to the pathogenesis of a variety of human lung diseases.",0
Do expert assessments converge? An exploratory case study of evaluating and managing a blood supply risk,"

This paper presents an exploration of the convergence of expert opinions regarding the evaluation and management of a risk to a blood supply. A case study was conducted in order to understand when, why, and how convergent decisions occur among experts. It was found that while there are variations between individual decisions, assessments do eventually converge given adequate time for deliberation. Applying evidence-based practices informed by decision support tools enabled more effective identification and mitigation of structural risks associated with the blood supply scenario analyzed here. The results concluded that expert assessments often converge provided they have access to well-designed decision support resources which can aid in considering all reasonable possibilities and building consensus across stakeholders. Practical recommendations are put forward on applying evidenced based practices (EBPs) where policy makers should consider utilizing such measures as part of their overarching assessment protocols as it has been demonstrated as highly useful for mitigating risks associated with complex systems like those that involve managing a blood supply safety issue efficiently",1
Confronting Potential Influenza A (H5N1) Pandemic with Better Vaccines,"Influenza A (H5N1) viruses are strong candidates for causing the next influenza pandemic if they acquire the ability for efficient human-to-human transmission. A major public health goal is to make efficacious vaccines against these viruses by using novel approaches, including cell-culture system, reverse genetics, and adjuvant development. Important consideration for the strategy includes preparation of vaccines from a currently circulating strain to induce broad-spectrum immunity toward newly emerged human H5 strains. This strategy would be a good solution early in a pandemic until an antigenically matched and approved vaccine is produced. The concept of therapeutic vaccines (e.g., antidisease vaccine) directed at diminishing the cytokine storm frequently seen in subtype H5N1–infected persons is underscored. Better understanding of host–virus interaction is essential to identify tools to produce effective vaccines against influenza (H5N1).",0
A random walk model for infection on graphs: spread of epidemics & rumours with mobile agents,"

This paper explores the application of a random walk model for modeling infectious processes on graphs. This approach requires us to analyze how epidemics and rumors spread throughout networks using mobile agents which further advances our understanding of outbreak dynamics at an individual level. We study interactions between multiple components, including human and non-human hosts, across different scales. With the help of this method, we explore special cases such as restricted lifetime mobility patterns in people and animals, additional transmission mediated by environmental elements and variations in the speed that information travels through networks. The results indicate that more accurate representation can be achieved with integration of both short range contacts between individuals within a cluster or region & propagation over long range connections among disparate groups. Potential implications for public health practices are discussed along with directions for future research regarding disease control strategies utilizing modern technologies involving multi-dimensional linkages between populations around the world",1
"Multinational, observational study of procalcitonin in ICU patients with pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation: a multicenter observational study","

The current study titled ‘Multinational, observational study of procalcitonin in ICU patients with pneumonia requiring mechanical ventilation: a multicenter observational study' aimed to investigate the potential role of procalcitonin (PCT) for diagnosing and managing invasion of bacterial pathogens among adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients with pneumonia necessitating mechanical ventilation. The objective was to evaluate the impact on health outcomes by measuring plasma PCT concentrations from medical records and compare it against laboratory-confirmed bacterial pathogen invasion results, recorded over two years. A comprehensive multinational prospective database was utilized, sourced from three European countries; Belgium, Italy and Romania containing more than five thousand patient’s medical data. Multivariate analysis techniques were applied to estimate association between trends observed based on clinical features such as duration at hospitalization, treatment administered etc. The overwhelming findings provide an invaluable insight into improved early diagnosis/treatment planning regime against septic infection as well as its efficacy assessment among adult critically ill patients admitted in ICUs due to pneumonic complications needing ventilator support.",1
"Comparative Efficacy of Hemagglutinin, Nucleoprotein, and Matrix 2 Protein Gene-Based Vaccination against H5N1 Influenza in Mouse and Ferret","Efforts to develop a broadly protective vaccine against the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (HPAI) H5N1 virus have focused on highly conserved influenza gene products. The viral nucleoprotein (NP) and ion channel matrix protein (M2) are highly conserved among different strains and various influenza A subtypes. Here, we investigate the relative efficacy of NP and M2 compared to HA in protecting against HPAI H5N1 virus. In mice, previous studies have shown that vaccination with NP and M2 in recombinant DNA and/or adenovirus vectors or with adjuvants confers protection against lethal challenge in the absence of HA. However, we find that the protective efficacy of NP and M2 diminishes as the virulence and dose of the challenge virus are increased. To explore this question in a model relevant to human disease, ferrets were immunized with DNA/rAd5 vaccines encoding NP, M2, HA, NP+M2 or HA+NP+M2. Only HA or HA+NP+M2 vaccination conferred protection against a stringent virus challenge. Therefore, while gene-based vaccination with NP and M2 may provide moderate levels of protection against low challenge doses, it is insufficient to confer protective immunity against high challenge doses of H5N1 in ferrets. These immunogens may require combinatorial vaccination with HA, which confers protection even against very high doses of lethal viral challenge.",0
Accounting for Contribution of Trade Openness and Foreign Direct Investment in Life Expectancy: The Long-Run and Short-Run Analysis in Pakistan,"

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the long-run and short-run effects of trade openness and foreign direct investment (FDI) on life expectancy in Pakistan over 1975 to 2018 using quantile regression. The study accounts for the contribution of economic growth, labor productivity, human capital accumulation (education expenditure), public health expenditure, unemployment rate and financial development as mediating variables. It aims to assess how much FDI affects countries’ longevity which has been found limited empirical evidence with respect to developing countries. Moreover, this article offers meaningful implications for both government policy makers and practitioners about fostering human welfare through improving life expectancy by increasing trade openness and promoting FDI activities in Pakistan.",1
We should not be complacent about our population-based public health response to the first influenza pandemic of the 21(st )century,"BACKGROUND: More than a year after an influenza pandemic was declared in June 2009, the World Health Organization declared the pandemic to be over. Evaluations of the pandemic response are beginning to appear in the public domain. DISCUSSION: We argue that, despite the enormous effort made to control the pandemic, it is now time to acknowledge that many of the population-based public health interventions may not have been well considered. Prior to the pandemic, there was limited scientific evidence to support border control measures. In particular no border screening measures would have detected prodromal or asymptomatic infections, and asymptomatic infections with pandemic influenza were common. School closures, when they were partial or of short duration, would not have interrupted spread of the virus in school-aged children, the group with the highest rate of infection worldwide. In most countries where they were available, neuraminidase inhibitors were not distributed quickly enough to have had an effect at the population level, although they will have benefited individuals, and prophylaxis within closed communities will have been effective. A pandemic specific vaccine will have protected the people who received it, although in most countries only a small minority was vaccinated, and often a small minority of those most at risk. The pandemic vaccine was generally not available early enough to have influenced the shape of the first pandemic wave and it is likely that any future pandemic vaccine manufactured using current technology will also be available too late, at least in one hemisphere. SUMMARY: Border screening, school closure, widespread anti-viral prophylaxis and a pandemic-specific vaccine were unlikely to have been effective during a pandemic which was less severe than anticipated in the pandemic plans of many countries. These were cornerstones of the population-based public health response. Similar responses would be even less likely to be effective in a more severe pandemic. We agree with the recommendation from the World Health Organisation that pandemic preparedness plans need review.",0
"Molecular mechanisms of inflammation and tissue injury after major trauma-is complement the ""bad guy""?","

Abstract 
A key mechanism in the pathology of major trauma is inflammation, leading to tissue injury. The complement system has long been attributed as a mediator of inflammation and hence tissue injury. It has recently become apparent that complement activation may not necessarily be detrimental but might also have positive roles in regulating inflammation after major trauma. In this review article, we discuss molecular mechanisms of proinflammatory significantly contributing to the development inflammatory response and tissue injury observed following major trauma and comment on how modulating one part of the multidimensional process—the 'complement', can affect these processes. We seek to provide an updated synthesis regarding incorporation of early preventive strategies beyond pharmacological anti-inflammatory intervention based on regulation of specific components within the complement cascade to lessen acute or chronic organ damage resulting from severe physical trauma at local or remote sites. It is our hope that such information will further advance clinicians’ treatment capacity for patients with serious traumatic injuries helping them outpace life-threatening disease progression, post-traumatic complications, disabled behavior debilitation and other adverse consequences associated with significant reduced quality of life for both patients themselves as well as their caregivers over time though more extensive studies are needed before definitive conclusions can be drawn about effects by used drugs targeting pathways relevant for controlling physiological dangers posed by massive traumas.",1
The 'polysemous' codon--a codon with multiple amino acid assignment caused by dual specificity of tRNA identity.,"In some Candida species, the universal CUG leucine codon is translated as serine. However, in most cases, the serine tRNAs responsible for this non-universal decoding (tRNA(Ser)CAG) accept in vitro not only serine, but also, to some extent, leucine. Nucleotide replacement experiments indicated that m1G37 is critical for leucylation activity. This finding was supported by the fact that the tRNA(Ser)CAGs possessing the leucylation activity always have m1G37, whereas that of Candida cylindracea, which possesses no leucylation activity, has A37. Quantification of defined aminoacetylated tRNAs in cells demonstrated that 3% of the tRNA(Ser)CAGs possessing m1G37 were, in fact, charged with leucine in vivo. A genetic approach using an auxotroph mutant of C.maltosa possessing this type of tRNA(Ser)CAG also suggested that the URA3 gene inactivated due to the translation of CUG as serine was rescued by a slight incorporation of leucine into the polypeptide, which demonstrated that the tRNA charged with multiple amino acids could participate in the translation. These findings provide the first evidence that two distinct amino acids are assigned by a single codon, which occurs naturally in the translation process of certain Candida species. We term this novel type of codon a 'polysemous codon'.",0

New Respiratory Enterovirus and Recombinant Rhinoviruses among Circulating Picornaviruses,"Rhinoviruses and enteroviruses are leading causes of respiratory infections. To evaluate genotypic diversity and identify forces shaping picornavirus evolution, we screened persons with respiratory illnesses by using rhinovirus-specific or generic real-time PCR assays. We then sequenced the 5′ untranslated region, capsid protein VP1, and protease precursor 3CD regions of virus-positive samples. Subsequent phylogenetic analysis identified the large genotypic diversity of rhinoviruses circulating in humans. We identified and completed the genome sequence of a new enterovirus genotype associated with respiratory symptoms and acute otitis media, confirming the close relationship between rhinoviruses and enteroviruses and the need to detect both viruses in respiratory specimens. Finally, we identified recombinants among circulating rhinoviruses and mapped their recombination sites, thereby demonstrating that rhinoviruses can recombine in their natural host. This study clarifies the diversity and explains the reasons for evolution of these viruses.",0
Sustainability science: an ecohealth perspective,"

This article examines from an ecohealth perspective the emerging field of sustainability science and its potential to shape socio-ecological futures. Sustainability science is an evolving interdisciplinary field focusing on providing empirical knowledge, analytical models, and adaptive strategies in support of the achievement and maintenance of sustainable development. As a rapidly advancing academic discipline characterized by complexity and uncertainty, it has resulted in record levels of investment in research and education aimed at transitioning towards sustainable development goals. Ecohealth offers innovative ways to study complex determinants that are shaped by social processes such as resource use patterns, consumption practices and behaviours, societal norms and cultural values; all interacting within a nested system of biophysical contexts across scales ranging from the organismal up to global dynamics. Drawing upon multidisciplinary theories connected with collective action problems rooted in different realms (economic framework accounts for individual behaviour), this article argues that achieving a more effective engagement between nature’s innate dynamic resilience capabilities linked with ecosystem services supply chains can enhance opportunities for creating novel environmental governance structures necessary for supporting robust sustainability plans into future generations.",1
Self-Interest versus Group-Interest in Antiviral Control,"Antiviral agents have been hailed to hold considerable promise for the treatment and prevention of emerging viral diseases like H5N1 avian influenza and SARS. However, antiviral drugs are not completely harmless, and the conditions under which individuals are willing to participate in a large-scale antiviral drug treatment program are as yet unknown. We provide population dynamical and game theoretical analyses of large-scale prophylactic antiviral treatment programs. Throughout we compare the antiviral control strategy that is optimal from the public health perspective with the control strategy that would evolve if individuals make their own, rational decisions. To this end we investigate the conditions under which a large-scale antiviral control program can prevent an epidemic, and we analyze at what point in an unfolding epidemic the risk of infection starts to outweigh the cost of antiviral treatment. This enables investigation of how the optimal control strategy is moulded by the efficacy of antiviral drugs, the risk of mortality by antiviral prophylaxis, and the transmissibility of the pathogen. Our analyses show that there can be a strong incentive for an individual to take less antiviral drugs than is optimal from the public health perspective. In particular, when public health asks for early and aggressive control to prevent or curb an emerging pathogen, for the individual antiviral drug treatment is attractive only when the risk of infection has become non-negligible. It is even possible that from a public health perspective a situation in which everybody takes antiviral drugs is optimal, while the process of individual choice leads to a situation where nobody is willing to take antiviral drugs.",0
Successful treatment of HIV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease and multiple organ failure with rituximab and supportive care: a case report,"INTRODUCTION: Multicentric Castleman's Disease (MCD), a lymphoproliferative disorder associated with Human Herpes Virus-8 (HHV-8) infection, is increasing in incidence amongst HIV patients. This condition is associated with lymphadenopathy, polyclonal gammopathy, hepato-splenomegaly and systemic symptoms. A number of small studies have demonstrated the efficacy of the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, rituximab, in treating this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 46 year old Zambian woman who presented with pyrexia, diarrhoea and vomiting, confusion, lymphadenopathy, and renal failure. She rapidly developed multiple organ failure following the initiation of treatment of MCD with rituximab. Following admission to intensive care (ICU), she received prompt multi-organ support. After 21 days on the ICU she returned to the haematology medical ward, and was discharged in remission from her disease after 149 days in hospital. CONCLUSION: Rituximab, the efficacy of which has thus far been examined predominantly in patients outside the ICU, in conjunction with extensive organ support was effective treatment for MCD with associated multiple organ failure. There is, to our knowledge, only one other published report of its successful use in an ICU setting, where it was combined with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and prednisolone. Reports such as ours support the notion that critically unwell patients with HIV and haematological disease can benefit from intensive care.",0
Role of endothelin-1 in lung disease,"Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a 21 amino acid peptide with diverse biological activity that has been implicated in numerous diseases. ET-1 is a potent mitogen regulator of smooth muscle tone, and inflammatory mediator that may play a key role in diseases of the airways, pulmonary circulation, and inflammatory lung diseases, both acute and chronic. This review will focus on the biology of ET-1 and its role in lung disease.",0
Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis and some other medicinal plants commonly used in South-East Asia,"BACKGROUND: Eight medicinal plants were tested for their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Different extraction methods were also tested for their effects on the bioactivities of the medicinal plants. METHODS: Eight plants, namely Herba Polygonis Hydropiperis (Laliaocao), Folium Murraya Koenigii (Jialiye), Rhizoma Arachis Hypogea (Huashenggen), Herba Houttuyniae (Yuxingcao), Epipremnum pinnatum (Pashulong), Rhizoma Typhonium Flagelliforme (Laoshuyu), Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis (Houpo) and Rhizoma Imperatae (Baimaogen) were investigated for their potential antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. RESULTS: Extracts of Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis had the strongest activities against M. Smegmatis, C. albicans, B. subtilis and S. aureus. Boiled extracts of Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis, Folium Murraya Koenigii, Herba Polygonis Hydropiperis and Herba Houttuyniae demonstrated greater antioxidant activities than other tested medicinal plants. CONCLUSION: Among the eight tested medicinal plants, Cortex Magnoliae Officinalis showed the highest antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Different methods of extraction yield different spectra of bioactivities.",0
Detection of a Fourth Orbivirus Non-Structural Protein,"

This investigative research paper presents the findings of a team of scientists who acquired the first evidence suggesting a unique non-structural protein (nsP) in an orbivirus. Orbiviruses are double-stranded RNA viruses that primarily affect ruminant animals and have been described as pathogenic in various species, including cattle, deer and sheep. This discovery further expands our knowledge on the structure and mechanics of these particular types of viral infections, as well as offers new potential for targeted diagnostic methods. By using sequencing techniques followed by computational analysis, this cohort discovered evidence indicative of nsP4 that has heretofore eluded recognition due to its lack of homology with previously identified sequences commonly associated with other orbiviruses. This article focuses on exploring the implications going forward consequent to this landmark finding - both encouraging prospects concerning virus control development strategies, such active targeting of nsP4 encode proteins; and ethical considerations relating to agricultural practice changes informed by such detections - through rigorous experimentation guided by phylogenetic studies and supervised laboratory tests.

Virus contaminations of cell cultures – A biotechnological view,"

This article aims to explore the biotechnological implications of virus contaminations on cell cultures. Cell culture is a major technology used in modern times, prominently seen in both discovery and development of therapeutic drugs as well as genetic manipulation and testing. Despite several advances being made over the years, viral contamination continues to be a serious issue which affects not only the eventual accuracy of experiments, but also carrying financial loss for scientists using them. To properly illustrate this area of research from a biotechnologically rooted point-of-view, recent cases will be highlighted along with various precautionary measures that should employed by laboratories and how confirmation studies are conducted to ensure sample purity prior to experimentation. This study emphasizes upon prevention rather than attempting treatment after successful infection – an approach impractical when dealing with such invasive particles - because once contamination has occurred it is difficult if not impossible to reverse its effects associated with decreased product quality or even irrevocable damage at times. Virus contaminations represent an ever present challenge within biomedical research so utilizing adequate protective protocol can make all the difference between accurate outcomes generated from viable cell material or results afflicted by extrinsic agents leading researcher astray devastatingly costly endeavor overall.",1
Listeriolysin O Is Necessary and Sufficient to Induce Autophagy during Listeria monocytogenes Infection,"BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that autophagy is utilized by cells as a protective mechanism against Listeria monocytogenes infection. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: However we find autophagy has no measurable role in vacuolar escape and intracellular growth in primary cultured bone marrow derived macrophages (BMDMs) deficient for autophagy (atg5(−/−)). Nevertheless, we provide evidence that the pore forming activity of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin listeriolysin O (LLO) can induce autophagy subsequent to infection by L. monocytogenes. Infection of BMDMs with L. monocytogenes induced microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) lipidation, consistent with autophagy activation, whereas a mutant lacking LLO did not. Infection of BMDMs that express LC3-GFP demonstrated that wild-type L. monocytogenes was encapsulated by LC3-GFP, consistent with autophagy activation, whereas a mutant lacking LLO was not. Bacillus subtilis expressing either LLO or a related cytolysin, perfringolysin O (PFO), induced LC3 colocalization and LC3 lipidation. Further, LLO-containing liposomes also recruited LC3-GFP, indicating that LLO was sufficient to induce targeted autophagy in the absence of infection. The role of autophagy had variable effects depending on the cell type assayed. In atg5(−/−) mouse embryonic fibroblasts, L. monocytogenes had a primary vacuole escape defect. However, the bacteria escaped and grew normally in atg5(−/−) BMDMs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We propose that membrane damage, such as that caused by LLO, triggers bacterial-targeted autophagy, although autophagy does not affect the fate of wild-type intracellular L. monocytogenes in primary BMDMs.",0
"Global public goods and the global health agenda: problems, priorities and potential","The 'global public good' (GPG) concept has gained increasing attention, in health as well as development circles. However, it has suffered in finding currency as a general tool for global resource mobilisation, and is at risk of being attached to almost anything promoting development. This overstretches and devalues the validity and usefulness of the concept. This paper first defines GPGs and describes the policy challenge that they pose. Second, it identifies two key areas, health R&D and communicable disease control, in which the GPG concept is clearly relevant and considers the extent to which it has been applied. We point out that that, while there have been many new initiatives, it is not clear that additional resources from non-traditional sources have been forthcoming. Yet achieving this is, in effect, the entire purpose of applying the GPG concept in global health. Moreover, the proliferation of disease-specific programs associated with GPG reasoning has tended to promote vertical interventions at the expense of more general health sector strengthening. Third, we examine two major global health policy initiatives, the Global Fund against AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFATM) and the bundling of long-standing international health goals in the form of Millennium Development Goals (MDG), asking how the GPG perspective has contributed to defining objectives and strategies. We conclude that both initiatives are best interpreted in the context of traditional development assistance and, one-world rhetoric aside, have little to do with the challenge posed by GPGs for health. The paper concludes by considering how the GPG concept can be more effectively used to promote global health.",0
Environmental factors preceding illness onset differ in phenotypes of the juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies,"Objective. To assess whether certain environmental factors temporally associated with the onset of juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (JIIMs) differ between phenotypes. Methods. Physicians completed questionnaires regarding documented infections, medications, immunizations and an open-ended question about other noted exposures within 6 months before illness onset for 285 patients with probable or definite JIIM. Medical records were reviewed for 81% of the patients. Phenotypes were defined by standard clinical and laboratory measures. Results. Sixty per cent of JIIM patients had a reported exposure within 6 months before illness onset. Most patients (62%) had one recorded exposure, 26% had two and 12% had three to five exposures. Patients older than the median age at diagnosis, those with a longer delay to diagnosis and those with anti-signal recognition particle autoantibodies had a higher frequency of documented exposures [odds ratios (ORs) 95% CI 3.4, 31]. Infections were the most common exposure and represented 44% of the total number of reported exposures. Non-infectious exposures included medications (18%), immunizations (11%), stressful life events (11%) and unusual sun exposure (7%). Exposures varied by age at diagnosis, race, disease course and the presence of certain myositis autoantibodies. Conclusion. The JIIMs may be related to multiple exposures and these appear to vary among phenotypes.",0
The immunoregulatory and allergy-associated cytokines in the aetiology of the otitis media with effusion.,"Inflammation in the middle ear mucosa, which can be provoked by different primary factors such as bacterial and viral infection, local allergic reactions and reflux, is the crucial event in the pathogenesis of otitis media with effusion (OME). Unresolved acute inflammatory responses or defective immunoregulation of middle inflammation can promote chronic inflammatory processes and stimulate the chronic condition of OME. Cytokines are the central molecular regulators of middle ear inflammation and can switch the acute phase of inflammation in the chronic stage and induce molecular-pathological processes leading to the histopathological changes accompanying OME. In this review we present cytokines identified in otitis media, immunoregulatory [interleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, transforming growth factor-beta]) and allergy associated (IL-4, IL-5, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor), as crucial molecular regulators, responsible for chronic inflammation in the middle ear and the chronic condition of OME.",0
"ElaD, a Deubiquitinating Protease Expressed by E. coli","BACKGROUND: Ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like proteins (Ubl) are designed to modify polypeptides in eukaryotes. Covalent binding of ubiquitin or Ubls to substrate proteins can be reversed by specific hydrolases. One particular set of cysteine proteases, the CE clan, which targets ubiquitin and Ubls, has homologs in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. FINDINGS: We have cloned and analyzed the E. coli protein elaD, which is distantly related to eukaryotic CE clan members of the ULP/SENP protease family that are specific for SUMO and Nedd8. Previously misannotated as a putative sulfatase/phosphatase, elaD is an efficient and specific deubiquitinating enzyme in vitro. Interestingly, elaD is present in all intestinal pathogenic E. coli strains, but conspicuously absent from extraintestinal pathogenic strains (ExPECs). Further homologs of this protease can be found in Acanthamoeba Polyphaga Mimivirus, and in Alpha-, Beta-and Gammaproteobacteria. CONCLUSION: The expression of ULP/SENP-related hydrolases in bacteria therefore extends to plant pathogens and medically relevant strains of Escherichia coli, Legionella pneumophila, Rickettsiae, Chlamydiae, and Salmonellae, in which the elaD ortholog sseL has recently been identified as a virulence factor with deubiquitinating activity. As a counterpoint, our phylogenetic and functional examination reveals that ancient eukaryotic ULP/SENP proteases also have the potential of ubiquitin-specific hydrolysis, suggesting an early common origin of this peptidase clan.",0
Short-hairpin RNAs delivered by lentiviral vector transduction trigger RIG-I-mediated IFN activation,"Activation of the type I interferon (IFN) pathway by small interfering RNA (siRNA) is a major contributor to the off-target effects of RNA interference in mammalian cells. While IFN induction complicates gene function studies, immunostimulation by siRNAs may be beneficial in certain therapeutic settings. Various forms of siRNA, meeting different compositional and structural requirements, have been reported to trigger IFN activation. The consensus is that intracellularly expressed short-hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) are less prone to IFN activation because they are not detected by the cell-surface receptors. In particular, lentiviral vector-mediated transduction of shRNAs has been reported to avoid IFN response. Here we identify a shRNA that potently activates the IFN pathway in human cells in a sequence- and 5′-triphosphate-dependent manner. In addition to suppressing its intended mRNA target, expression of the shRNA results in dimerization of interferon regulatory factor-3, activation of IFN promoters and secretion of biologically active IFNs into the extracellular medium. Delivery by lentiviral vector transduction did not avoid IFN activation by this and another, unrelated shRNA. We also demonstrated that retinoic-acid-inducible gene I, and not melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 or toll-like receptor 3, is the cytoplasmic sensor for intracellularly expressed shRNAs that trigger IFN activation.",0
The influenza pandemic preparedness planning tool InfluSim,"BACKGROUND: Planning public health responses against pandemic influenza relies on predictive models by which the impact of different intervention strategies can be evaluated. Research has to date rather focused on producing predictions for certain localities or under specific conditions, than on designing a publicly available planning tool which can be applied by public health administrations. Here, we provide such a tool which is reproducible by an explicitly formulated structure and designed to operate with an optimal combination of the competing requirements of precision, realism and generality. RESULTS: InfluSim is a deterministic compartment model based on a system of over 1,000 differential equations which extend the classic SEIR model by clinical and demographic parameters relevant for pandemic preparedness planning. It allows for producing time courses and cumulative numbers of influenza cases, outpatient visits, applied antiviral treatment doses, hospitalizations, deaths and work days lost due to sickness, all of which may be associated with economic aspects. The software is programmed in Java, operates platform independent and can be executed on regular desktop computers. CONCLUSION: InfluSim is an online available software which efficiently assists public health planners in designing optimal interventions against pandemic influenza. It can reproduce the infection dynamics of pandemic influenza like complex computer simulations while offering at the same time reproducibility, higher computational performance and better operability.",0
Analysis of codon usage in Newcastle disease virus,"

This paper presents an analysis into the codon usage of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a member of the avian Paramyxoviridae family and cause of fatal illness in domestic poultry. The research utilizes methods including sequence alignment, BLASTX searching, sequence manipulation and statistical categorization in order to determine how context-dependent factors such as natural selection, mutational bias and environmental condition exerts effects on this pathogen’s codon preference, aiming to provide insights that support molecular evolution studies. Results indicate variability in NDV gene expression between genotypes and over time depending on the open reading frame examined. Furthermore data acquired reveals optimal GC or AU-rich contexts favoring several expressed genes along with unusual motif biases for certain amino acids among some evidence for limited tRNA overloading in genome regions. These results are compared to known trends observed for other viruses/organisms highlighting similarities yet providing insight into specific evolutionary pressures experienced by NDV at present due to its environment which could be used further enhance current vaccine design strategies.",1
Regulated multicistronic expression technology for mammalian metabolic engineering,"

This study presents a novel, regulated multicistronic expression technology for mammalian metabolic engineering. The technique aims to expand the capabilities of metabolic engineering by enabling tight control of transgene expression through tunable gene regulatory elements and operon structures that can be tailored to specific application needs. By using this approach, we demonstrate successful production of multiple products from engineered cellular pathways while also increasing yield compared to single-cistron systems. Our data suggests that this methodology offers wide applicability across various metabolic engineering projects in industrial biotechnology applications including biomedical therapies and diagnostics, biofuels production, nutrition supplements manufacturing and more. We believe the optimized strategies presented here have great potential for large scale commercialization of improved mammalian cell lines with complex multi-step biosynthesis processes.",1
"Lessons from the History of Quarantine, from Plague to Influenza A","

This study offers an analysis of the long and troublesome history of quarantine in relation to major infectious disease epidemics, from medical institutions’ perspectives across time. Quarantine is one of humanity's oldest strategies for combatting infectious diseases, but it has also created significant cultural and ethical issues. Examining this practice through its historical lens provides useful insights into how societies have adopted and adapted quarantine methods in response to epidemics such as plague, cholera and influenza A. Herein we review the key factors associated with these past quarantines - their effectiveness at containing contagion, legal tribulations related to liberty breaches, economic consequences resulting from prolonged confinement - thereby providing contemporary public health policymakers with pertinent morality-based lessons for future pandemics.",1
Protective Efficacy of Cross-Reactive CD8(+) T Cells Recognising Mutant Viral Epitopes Depends on Peptide-MHC-I Structural Interactions and T Cell Activation Threshold,"Emergence of a new influenza strain leads to a rapid global spread of the virus due to minimal antibody immunity. Pre-existing CD8(+) T-cell immunity directed towards conserved internal viral regions can greatly ameliorate the disease. However, mutational escape within the T cell epitopes is a substantial issue for virus control and vaccine design. Although mutations can result in a loss of T cell recognition, some variants generate cross-reactive T cell responses. In this study, we used reverse genetics to modify the influenza NP(336–374) peptide at a partially-solvent exposed residue (N->A, NPN3A mutation) to assess the availability, effectiveness and mechanism underlying influenza-specific cross-reactive T cell responses. The engineered virus induced a diminished CD8(+) T cell response and selected a narrowed T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire within two Vβ regions (Vβ8.3 and Vβ9). This can be partially explained by the H-2D(b)NPN3A structure that showed a loss of several contacts between the NPN3A peptide and H-2D(b), including a contact with His155, a position known to play an important role in mediating TCR-pMHC-I interactions. Despite these differences, common cross-reactive TCRs were detected in both the naïve and immune NPN3A-specific TCR repertoires. However, while the NPN3A epitope primes memory T-cells that give an equivalent recall response to the mutant or wild-type (wt) virus, both are markedly lower than wt->wt challenge. Such decreased CD8(+) responses elicited after heterologous challenge resulted in delayed viral clearance from the infected lung. Furthermore, mice first exposed to the wt virus give a poor, low avidity response following secondary infection with the mutant. Thus, the protective efficacy of cross-reactive CD8(+) T cells recognising mutant viral epitopes depend on peptide-MHC-I structural interactions and functional avidity. Our study does not support vaccine strategies that include immunization against commonly selected cross-reactive variants with mutations at partially-solvent exposed residues that have characteristics comparable to NPN3A.",0
Correcting the Actual Reproduction Number: A Simple Method to Estimate R(0) from Early Epidemic Growth Data,"The basic reproduction number, R(0), a summary measure of the transmission potential of an infectious disease, is estimated from early epidemic growth rate, but a likelihood-based method for the estimation has yet to be developed. The present study corrects the concept of the actual reproduction number, offering a simple framework for estimating R(0) without assuming exponential growth of cases. The proposed method is applied to the HIV epidemic in European countries, yielding R(0) values ranging from 3.60 to 3.74, consistent with those based on the Euler-Lotka equation. The method also permits calculating the expected value of R(0) using a spreadsheet.",0
Quercetin 7-rhamnoside reduces porcine epidemic diarrhea virus replication via independent pathway of viral induced reactive oxygen species,"

This study investigates the effect of Quercetin 7-rhamnoside (Q7R) on Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus (PEDV). Previous findings have highlighted oxidative stress as a key mechanism in viral replication, yet investigations have not been able to differentiate between reactive oxygen species (ROS) substrates induced by PEDV and those which are independent. Q7R is an agricultural flavonoid with anti-oxidancy properties, however its capacity to suppress the replication of PEDV has rarely been studied. In this study we investigated whether using 167 μM Q7R had any impact on reducing ROS levels produced from infected Vero E6 cells with 1x105 PFU/ml PEDV strain DYJ4 full length genome. Results showed that Q7R significantly reduces ERA induced by TNF‐α or H2O2 in VeroE6 cell but does not affect gene expression due to double stranded breakage at nanomolar concentrations. Thus, our results affirm that dietary supplementation of Q7R can dampen excessive ROS production internalised within PEDV, indicating separate independent pathways for both effects.",1
The Integrated Information Architecture: A Pilot Study Approach to Leveraging Logistics Management with Regard to Influenza Preparedness,"

This paper presents an integrated information architecture for alleviating the logistical burden associated with influenza preparedness. The proposed system offers advanced analytics and a suite of operating mechanisms to streamline the supply chain, improve inventory management, and enhance outbreak readiness across healthcare organizations. Through a pilot study approach conducted in four major metropolitan cities, key findings are highlighted covering various analysis related to infrastructure requirements, workflow optimization tools, patient tracking systems and assessment resources needed during pandemic events. Furthermore implications on leveraging this platform as best practices for managing current pandemics and future global health threats are discussed together with addressing potential risks features due to limited scale-up capacity inherent with such an initiative. This article provides an evidence-based foundation which can further facilitate useful cross country comparisons among different data sets ultimately allowing more adequate implementations under varying administrative settings worldwide.",1
Prediction of mutations engineered by randomness in H5N1 hemagglutinins of influenza A virus,"

This study proposes a novel approach towards understanding the impact of random mutations on H5N1 hemagglutinin, or HA, proteins in influenza A virus. The ability to predict mutations generated due to genetic shuffling has become increasingly important in order to prevent the emergence of new pathogenic strains and appropriately respond during an outbreak. Recent advances in methods related to protein engineering as well as mathematical modelling offer unprecedented opportunities for us to explore how various mutation protocols affect HA structures and subsequently support a targeted laboratory selection process for enhanced potency. Examining these changes will be essential for our overall comprehension of the intricate mechanisms that define HA protein stability so that appropriate immunoprophylactical measures can be developed from this insight. In this work we propose, implement, and analyze allostery-driven mutation strategies for predicting potential avenues by which HA proteins could adapt within their environment.",1
Sequence requirements for RNA strand transfer during nidovirus discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis,"Nidovirus subgenomic mRNAs contain a leader sequence derived from the 5′ end of the genome fused to different sequences (‘bodies’) derived from the 3′ end. Their generation involves a unique mechanism of discontinuous subgenomic RNA synthesis that resembles copy-choice RNA recombination. During this process, the nascent RNA strand is transferred from one site in the template to another, during either plus or minus strand synthesis, to yield subgenomic RNA molecules. Central to this process are transcription-regulating sequences (TRSs), which are present at both template sites and ensure the fidelity of strand transfer. Here we present results of a comprehensive co-variation mutagenesis study of equine arteritis virus TRSs, demonstrating that discontinuous RNA synthesis depends not only on base pairing between sense leader TRS and antisense body TRS, but also on the primary sequence of the body TRS. While the leader TRS merely plays a targeting role for strand transfer, the body TRS fulfils multiple functions. The sequences of mRNA leader–body junctions of TRS mutants strongly suggested that the discontinuous step occurs during minus strand synthesis.",0
Deciphering Novel Host–Herpesvirus Interactions by Virion Proteomics,"

This study examines and delineates the functional roles of viruses by characterising individual virion components, which are essential in understanding novel host–herpesvirus interactions. Viral genomes encode the molecular apparatus needed to hijack their hosts’ metabolism and to manipulate intracellular pathways, often resulting in pathological manifestations. However, key elements on how viruses interact during different stages remain elusive due to inadequacies in traditional proteomic approaches. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of herpesviruses using high-resolution techniques that investigate host–pathogen crosstalk during infection with profound implications for improving antiviral strategies targeting these devastating infections.",1
Hepatitis G Virus associated aplastic anemia: A recent case from Pakistan,"BACKGROUND: Aplastic anemia (AA) is a serious and rare disorder characterized by a hypocellular bone marrow. Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a variant of aplastic anemia in which aplastic anemia follows an acute attack of hepatitis. Several reports have noted an association between HGV and hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia besides other hepatitis causing viruses. CASE PRESENTATION: A female girl of age 11 year with a history of loose motion for one month, vomiting for last 15 days and poor oral intake for last few days is reported here. The physical examination presents fever, pallor whereas bleeding, hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and bruising were absent, abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the absence of hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and lymphodenopathy. The laboratory investigation parameters were: haemoglobin 6.2 g/L, total leucocytes count 1.51, neutrophils 0.47%, absolute reticulocyte count 0.5%, Monocytes 0.16%, red cell count 3.2 mil/uL, Picked cell volume (PCV) 30.13%, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) 78 fL, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) 26.3 pg. The liver enzymes were alanine aminotransferease (ALT) 98 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 114 IU/L. Serologic and molecular tests for hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, TTV, B19 were negative, whereas HGV RNA PCR test was found positive for hepatitis G virus. The bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy examination revealed hypo- cellularity, erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. CONCLUSION: HAAA is an uncommon but severe condition, which may occur following idiopathic cases of acute hepatitis. Our finding suggests the involvement of HGV in the development of aplastic anemia. In patients presenting with pancytopenia after an episode of acute hepatitis, the definitive diagnosis should be considered and confirmed by RT-PCR and if possible by bone marrow biopsy.",0
Influenza pandemic intervention planning using InfluSim: pharmaceutical and non- pharmaceutical interventions,"BACKGROUND: Influenza pandemic preparedness plans are currently developed and refined on national and international levels. Much attention has been given to the administration of antiviral drugs, but contact reduction can also be an effective part of mitigation strategies and has the advantage to be not limited per se. The effectiveness of these interventions depends on various factors which must be explored by sensitivity analyses, based on mathematical models. METHODS: We use the freely available planning tool InfluSim to investigate how pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions can mitigate an influenza pandemic. In particular, we examine how intervention schedules, restricted stockpiles and contact reduction (social distancing measures and isolation of cases) determine the course of a pandemic wave and the success of interventions. RESULTS: A timely application of antiviral drugs combined with a quick implementation of contact reduction measures is required to substantially protract the peak of the epidemic and reduce its height. Delays in the initiation of antiviral treatment (e.g. because of parsimonious use of a limited stockpile) result in much more pessimistic outcomes and can even lead to the paradoxical effect that the stockpile is depleted earlier compared to early distribution of antiviral drugs. CONCLUSION: Pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures should not be used exclusively. The protraction of the pandemic wave is essential to win time while waiting for vaccine development and production. However, it is the height of the peak of an epidemic which can easily overtax general practitioners, hospitals or even whole public health systems, causing bottlenecks in basic and emergency medical care.",0
Gene Expression Profiling in Cells with Enhanced γ-Secretase Activity,"BACKGROUND: Processing by γ-secretase of many type-I membrane protein substrates triggers signaling cascades by releasing intracellular domains (ICDs) that, following nuclear translocation, modulate the transcription of different genes regulating a diverse array of cellular and biological processes. Because the list of γ-secretase substrates is growing quickly and this enzyme is a cancer and Alzheimer's disease therapeutic target, the mapping of γ-secretase activity susceptible gene transcription is important for sharpening our view of specific affected genes, molecular functions and biological pathways. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify genes and molecular functions transcriptionally affected by γ-secretase activity, the cellular transcriptomes of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with enhanced and inhibited γ-secretase activity were analyzed and compared by cDNA microarray. The functional clustering by FatiGO of the 1,981 identified genes revealed over- and under-represented groups with multiple activities and functions. Single genes with the most pronounced transcriptional susceptibility to γ-secretase activity were evaluated by real-time PCR. Among the 21 validated genes, the strikingly decreased transcription of PTPRG and AMN1 and increased transcription of UPP1 potentially support data on cell cycle disturbances relevant to cancer, stem cell and neurodegenerative diseases' research. The mapping of interactions of proteins encoded by the validated genes exclusively relied on evidence-based data and revealed broad effects on Wnt pathway members, including WNT3A and DVL3. Intriguingly, the transcription of TERA, a gene of unknown function, is affected by γ-secretase activity and was significantly altered in the analyzed human Alzheimer's disease brain cortices. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Investigating the effects of γ-secretase activity on gene transcription has revealed several affected clusters of molecular functions and, more specifically, 21 genes that hold significant potential for a better understanding of the biology of γ-secretase and its roles in cancer and Alzheimer's disease pathology.",0

A novel strategy for efficient production of anti-V3 human scFvs against HIV-1 clade C,"

This paper presents a novel strategy we have developed to efficiently produce clade C HIV-1 specific single chain fragment variant (scFv) antibodies. Antibodies against the third variable region of the Envelope glycoprotein, known as V3, can be utilized for protective interventions via passive immunization or treatment with antiretroviral microbicides. Currently generated anti-V3 scFvs are laborious and inefficient production processes with varying results. To address these issues, we describe a unique combinatorial expression system utilizing a library consisting of human antibody fragments composed by two non-contiguous light chains and two non-contiguous heavy chains bridged by three linkers. This platform was tested against 4 subtypes from clade C HIV isolates in vitro using surface plasmon resonance technology (SPR). Data demonstrate that our optimized construct correctly binds to envelope specific regions displaying favorable binding activity toward clade C subtypes compared to other production methods tested under same conditions. We expect this recombinant based method will facilitate large scale generation of potent anti-V3 human scFvs against HIV-1 suitable for clinical application aiding development of effective microbicides and treatments addressing local paths caused by different variants across globe affecting millions worldwide today",1
Renalase's Expression and Distribution in Renal Tissue and Cells,"

This paper investigates the expression and distribution of Renalase in renal tissue and cells. To this effect, we examine the localisation features of Renalase at both cellular and molecular level along with its functional association to renal physiology. To gain insight into the associations between Renalase expression levels and renal function, we have applied a combination of biochemical assays together with animalbased experimental models. Our findings uncover an integral role for Renalase in normal kidney biology and suggest a central involvement in kidney disease progression. The significance of these results offer novel perspectives on potential strategies to harness endogenous regulators such as Renalase to modify cardiovascular or metabolic outcomes associated with abnormal kidney functions.",1
Using Complementary and Alternative Medicines to Target the Host Response during Severe Influenza,"It is now accepted that an overwhelming inflammatory response is the cause of human deaths from avian H5N1 influenza infection. With this in mind we sought to examine the literature for examples of complementary and alternative medicines that reduce inflammation, and to place the results of this search in the context of our own work in a mouse model of influenza disease, using a pharmaceutical agent with anti-inflammatory properties. Two Chinese herbs, Angelica sinensis (Dang Gui) and Salvia miltiorrhiza (Danshen), have been recently shown to protect mice during lethal experimental sepsis via inhibition of the novel inflammatory cytokine High Mobility Group Box 1 protein (HMGB1). Biochanin A, a ligand of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) alpha and gamma and the active isoflavone in Trifolium pratense (red clover), has anti-inflammatory properties, and thus could be used as an influenza treatment. This is of great interest since we have recently shown that gemfibrozil, a drug used to treat hyperlipidemia in humans and a synthetic ligand of PPAR alpha, significantly reduces the mortality associated with influenza infections in mice. The inflammation-modulating abilities of these natural agents should be considered in light of what is now known about the mechanisms of fatal influenza, and tested as potential candidates for influenza treatments in their own right, or as adjunct treatments to antivirals.",0
"Environmental Sampling for Avian Influenza Virus A (H5N1) in Live-Bird Markets, Indonesia","

This research paper presents an analysis of environmental sampling for Avian Influenza Virus A (H5N1) in live-bird markets to monitor and assess the risk of subclinical infection in wild birds. Sampling was conducted at a total of 61 sites over six provinces in Indonesia from February 2018 to December 2019. By surveying these commercial locations popular among various avian species, this study provides essential evidence for effective national strategies regarding prevention and control measures against H5N1 outbreaks. With visual assessment data collected directly from vendors, facilities and staffs involved in poultry trade, results demonstrate how variations concerning housing, handling practices and market density may influence the prevalence of pathogens across different regions. Therefore, findings suggest that implementation of preventive zoning with local adaptation is vital towards establishing sustainable protection services to reduce human contact with potential disease sources such as avian influenza virus infections while allowing reasonable access by customers to these commercial bird markets.",1
Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza Community Transmission Was Established in One Australian State When the Virus Was First Identified in North America,"BACKGROUND: In mid-June 2009 the State of Victoria in Australia appeared to have the highest notification rate of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza in the world. We hypothesise that this was because community transmission of pandemic influenza was already well established in Victoria at the time testing for the novel virus commenced. In contrast, this was not true for the pandemic in other parts of Australia, including Western Australia (WA). METHODS: We used data from detailed case follow-up of patients with confirmed infection in Victoria and WA to demonstrate the difference in the pandemic curve in two Australian states on opposite sides of the continent. We modelled the pandemic in both states, using a susceptible-infected-removed model with Bayesian inference accounting for imported cases. RESULTS: Epidemic transmission occurred earlier in Victoria and later in WA. Only 5% of the first 100 Victorian cases were not locally acquired and three of these were brothers in one family. By contrast, 53% of the first 102 cases in WA were associated with importation from Victoria. Using plausible model input data, estimation of the effective reproductive number for the Victorian epidemic required us to invoke an earlier date for commencement of transmission to explain the observed data. This was not required in modelling the epidemic in WA. CONCLUSION: Strong circumstantial evidence, supported by modelling, suggests community transmission of pandemic influenza was well established in Victoria, but not in WA, at the time testing for the novel virus commenced in Australia. The virus is likely to have entered Victoria and already become established around the time it was first identified in the US and Mexico.",0
Autonomous Targeting of Infectious Superspreaders Using Engineered Transmissible Therapies,"Infectious disease treatments, both pharmaceutical and vaccine, face three universal challenges: the difficulty of targeting treatments to high-risk ‘superspreader’ populations who drive the great majority of disease spread, behavioral barriers in the host population (such as poor compliance and risk disinhibition), and the evolution of pathogen resistance. Here, we describe a proposed intervention that would overcome these challenges by capitalizing upon Therapeutic Interfering Particles (TIPs) that are engineered to replicate conditionally in the presence of the pathogen and spread between individuals — analogous to ‘transmissible immunization’ that occurs with live-attenuated vaccines (but without the potential for reversion to virulence). Building on analyses of HIV field data from sub-Saharan Africa, we construct a multi-scale model, beginning at the single-cell level, to predict the effect of TIPs on individual patient viral loads and ultimately population-level disease prevalence. Our results show that a TIP, engineered with properties based on a recent HIV gene-therapy trial, could stably lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by ∼30-fold within 50 years and could complement current therapies. In contrast, optimistic antiretroviral therapy or vaccination campaigns alone could only lower HIV/AIDS prevalence by <2-fold over 50 years. The TIP's efficacy arises from its exploitation of the same risk factors as the pathogen, allowing it to autonomously penetrate superspreader populations, maintain efficacy despite behavioral disinhibition, and limit viral resistance. While demonstrated here for HIV, the TIP concept could apply broadly to many viral infectious diseases and would represent a new paradigm for disease control, away from pathogen eradication but toward robust disease suppression.",0
Surfactant therapy for acute respiratory failure in children: a systematic review and meta-analysis,"INTRODUCTION: Exogenous surfactant is used to treat acute respiratory failure in children, although the benefits and harms in this setting are not clear. The objective of the present systematic review is to assess the effect of exogenous pulmonary surfactant on all-cause mortality in children mechanically ventilated for acute respiratory failure. METHODS: We searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and Ovid Healthstar databases, the bibliographies of included trials and review articles, conference proceedings and trial registries. We included prospective, randomized, controlled trials of pulmonary surfactant that enrolled intubated and mechanically ventilated children with acute respiratory failure. We excluded trials that exclusively enrolled neonates or patients with asthma. Two reviewers independently rated trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed the methodologic quality. We quantitatively pooled the results of trials, where suitable, using a random effects model. RESULTS: Six trials randomizing 314 patients were included. Surfactant use reduced mortality (relative risk = 0.7, 95% confidence interval = 0.4 to 0.97, P = 0.04), was associated with increased ventilator-free days (weighted mean difference = 2.5 days, 95% confidence interval = 0.3 to 4.6 days, P = 0.02) and reduced the duration of ventilation (weighted mean difference = 2.3 days, 95% confidence interval = 0.1 to 4.4 days, P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Surfactant use decreased mortality, was associated with more ventilator-free days and reduced the duration of ventilation. No serious adverse events were reported.",0

HIV/AIDS prevention in China: A challenge for the new millennium,"China’s first HIV infection was officially reported in 1985 and by the end of 1996, there may have been up to 200,000 people affected nationwide. In 2001, this figure probably exceeded 600,000. By 2003, the predicted number of HIV cases had reached 1.5 million. At least 80,000 individuals now have fullblown AIDS. China may soon have the largest HIV-infected population in the world, possibly 6 million cases by 2005. With infection rates rising at about 30% per year, it is feared this figure might exceed 10 million by 2010. Although the Chinese government was initially slow to accept the problem, in the late 1990s definite changes began occurring. In 2003 Premier Wen Jiabao publicly shook the hand of an AIDS patient and his government promised to introduce a range of free HIV-related services. Large preventive education campaigns are now underway. Unfortunately, there will still be many obstacles in controlling the epidemic and preventing further spread of this disease. Without doubt, China faces a serious predicament in the new millennium, and one which will pose numerous challenges for preventive medicine.",0
Comparison of Humoral Immune Responses to Epstein-Barr Virus and Kaposi’s Sarcoma–Associated Herpesvirus Using a Viral Proteome Microarray,"

This study presents a comprehensive comparison of the humoral immune responses to Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) and Kaposi's Sarcoma–Associated Herpesvirus (KSHV). Using a Viral Proteome Microarray, we investigated whether these two DNA viruses initiate an equivalent antibody response. We examined multiple KSHV ORFs and EBV BZLF1, EA-D, and LMP2A antigens. Our findings showed that while all KSHV protein domains exhibited neutralization activity equal to or greater than EBV ORFs in serum samples from individuals with primary viral infection or vaccination induced immunity against one of the viruses, immunogenicity was only observed upon simultaneous stimulation with specific combinations of both virus types. Thus, these findings indicate that when examining humoral immune responses to complex herpesviruses such as KHSV and EBV respectively it is necessary to critically consider their combined activity on cellularity rather than in isolation for the establishment of successful vaccine candidates.",1
Technical Description of RODS: A Real-time Public Health Surveillance System,"This report describes the design and implementation of the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) system, a computer-based public health surveillance system for early detection of disease outbreaks. Hospitals send RODS data from clinical encounters over virtual private networks and leased lines using the Health Level 7 (HL7) message protocol. The data are sent in real time. RODS automatically classifies the registration chief complaint from the visit into one of seven syndrome categories using Bayesian classifiers. It stores the data in a relational database, aggregates the data for analysis using data warehousing techniques, applies univariate and multivariate statistical detection algorithms to the data, and alerts users of when the algorithms identify anomalous patterns in the syndrome counts. RODS also has a Web-based user interface that supports temporal and spatial analyses. RODS processes sales of over-the-counter health care products in a similar manner but receives such data in batch mode on a daily basis. RODS was used during the 2002 Winter Olympics and currently operates in two states—Pennsylvania and Utah. It has been and continues to be a resource for implementing, evaluating, and applying new methods of public health surveillance.",0

Molecular Mimicry as a Mechanism of Autoimmune Disease,"

Molecular mimicry as a novel mechanism of autoimmune diseases has been an evolving area of research in recent years. This article examines the concept of molecular mimicry and its potential role on the pathogenesis and progression of autoimmune disorders. Through extensive evaluation, this review establishes mechanisms by which host immune cells are deceived into attacking self-antigens through recognizing them as foreign molecules, unavoidably resulting in pathological tissue destruction and damage to normal body functioning. Further examination was given to key antigens proposed to be involved in pathogenic autoimmunity and how they lead ultimately to organ disruption, functional failure, illness and medical conditions. By elucidating the involvement between molecular mimicry behavior and acute onset of autoimmune disease symptoms like arthritis, lupus erythematosus multiple sclerosis this article offers insight into new treatments that take advantage from preemptively stopping these attacks before permanent damages occur due to irreversible inflammation processes over time. Finally, ongoing research areas are highlighted towards achieving further understanding on how identifying structural similarities between microbial proteins or other external toxins can allow better assessment protocols targeting prevention rather than cure alone.",1
The Transmissibility of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Commercial Poultry in Industrialised Countries,"BACKGROUND: With the increased occurrence of outbreaks of H5N1 worldwide there is concern that the virus could enter commercial poultry farms with severe economic consequences. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyse data from four recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in commercial poultry to estimate the farm-to-farm reproductive number for HPAI. The reproductive number is a key measure of the transmissibility of HPAI at the farm level because it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures. In these outbreaks the mean farm-to-farm reproductive number prior to controls ranged from 1.1 to 2.4, with the maximum farm-based reproductive number in the range 2.2 to 3.2. Enhanced bio-security, movement restrictions and prompt isolation of the infected farms in all four outbreaks substantially reduced the reproductive number, but it remained close to the threshold value 1 necessary to ensure the disease will be eradicated. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results show that depending on the particular situation in which an outbreak of avian influenza occurs, current controls might not be enough to eradicate the disease, and therefore a close monitoring of the outbreak is required. The method we used for estimating the reproductive number is straightforward to implement and can be used in real-time. It therefore can be a useful tool to inform policy decisions.",0
Factors Associated with Increased Risk Perception of Pandemic Influenza in Australia,"

This study aimed to identify any factors that may be associated with increased risk perception of pandemic influenza in Australia. In recent years, there have been several outbreaks of highly infectious diseases, such as the notorious H1N1 virus, which has caused great concern among Australians due to its rapid spread and drastic disruption to everyday life. Therefore, this research investigated how Australian adults perceive the threat posed by pandemic flu and whether certain socio-demographic variables are associated with an elevated sense of danger. Data were collected via a survey conducted on a sample of 1,000 residents aged 18-66 years old from around Australia. Results revealed that prior knowledge relating to public health dangers significantly contributed towards heightened awareness while other salient demographic traits were found not to influence risk perception scores. It is argued that it is essential for governments and public health institutions alike to promote sustained education campaigns throughout different sectors of society if individuals’ understanding concerning potential health risks is expected to reach satisfactory levels for optimal prevention strategies against future epidemics",1
"The Organisation of Ebola Virus Reveals a Capacity for Extensive, Modular Polyploidy","

The Organisation of Ebola Virus Reveals a Capacity for Extensive, Modular Polyploidy:
This article outlines the findings of an investigation into the organisation of the Ebola virus, which suggests its ability to take on multiple ploidies and form complex cellular structures in order to survive. By closely evaluating both further-expanded sequences as well as glycan capsid modifications observed under superior membrane resolution imaging techniques, researchers aimed to identify and characterize those structural components that are specific for highly pathogenic ebolaviruses capable of substantial genomic plasticity. Results revealed evidence for the presence of several separate segments within individual viral particles, in addition to  extracellular polymeric elements that exhibit a range from basic branching patterns up to more complicated double helix modes. These observations indicate a capacity for modular polyploidy by Ebola viruses, along with potential avenues toward therapeutic strategies targeting peptides or carbohydrates specifically associated with their extreme adaptability.",1
Flt3L Combined with Rapamycin Promotes Cardiac Allograft Tolerance by Inducing Regulatory Dendritic Cells and Allograft Autophagy in Mice,"

This study examines the efficacy of possessing Flt3L in combination with rapamycin to induce the transformation of regulatory dendritic cells (DC) and autophagy in allografts, thereby promoting cardinal tolerance.

The titular research outlines effects seen when mice recipients were injected with Flt3L pre-transplanting receiving cardiac grafts from donor strains unmatched on MHC haplotype. Involvement of DC was evaluated by examining gene expression levels between recipient control and experimental groups; cell surface marker analysis through flow cytometry then analyzed such results for interdependent toll-like receptors. The trial indicated that induction of activating receptor genes correlated positively with biological responses applicable along a range of drug applications, thus resulting both significant alterations throughout regulatory function alongside inducing stimuli engaging novel autophagy phenomena within grafted tissues.

The Y271 and I274 Amino Acids in Reverse Transcriptase of Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 Are Critical to Protein Stability,"Reverse transcriptase (RT) of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 plays a key role in initiating viral replication and is an important target for developing anti-HIV drugs. Our previous study showed that two mutations (Y271A and I274A) in the turn RT (Gln(269)-Arg(277)) abrogated viral replication, but the replication capacity and RT activity was discordant. In this study, we further investigated why alanine substitutions at these two sites would affect viral replication. We found that both RT activity and RT protein were almost undetectable in viral particles of these two mutants, although the Pr160(gag-pol) mutants were properly expressed, transported and incorporated. Using protease inhibition assay, we demonstrated a correlation between the degradation of the RT mutants and the activity of viral protease. Our native gel analysis indicated that the mutations at 271 and 274 amino acids might cause conformational changes, leading to the formation of higher order oligomers instead of dimers, resulting in increased protein instability and susceptibility to viral protease. Thus, residues 271 and 274 are critical to RT stability and resistance to viral protease. The conservation of the two amino acid residues among different strains of HIV-1 lent further support to this conclusion. The knowledge gained here may prove useful in drug design.",0
Early Assessment of Anxiety and Behavioral Response to Novel Swine-Origin Influenza A(H1N1),"BACKGROUND: Since late April, 2009, a novel influenza virus A (H1N1), generally referred to as the “swine flu,” has spread around the globe and infected hundreds of thousands of people. During the first few days after the initial outbreak in Mexico, extensive media coverage together with a high degree of uncertainty about the transmissibility and mortality rate associated with the virus caused widespread concern in the population. The spread of an infectious disease can be strongly influenced by behavioral changes (e.g., social distancing) during the early phase of an epidemic, but data on risk perception and behavioral response to a novel virus is usually collected with a substantial delay or after an epidemic has run its course. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we report the results from an online survey that gathered data (n = 6,249) about risk perception of the Influenza A(H1N1) outbreak during the first few days of widespread media coverage (April 28 - May 5, 2009). We find that after an initially high level of concern, levels of anxiety waned along with the perception of the virus as an immediate threat. Overall, our data provide evidence that emotional status mediates behavioral response. Intriguingly, principal component analysis revealed strong clustering of anxiety about swine flu, bird flu and terrorism. All three of these threats receive a great deal of media attention and their fundamental uncertainty is likely to generate an inordinate amount of fear vis-a-vis their actual threat. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that respondents' behavior varies in predictable ways. Of particular interest, we find that affective variables, such as self-reported anxiety over the epidemic, mediate the likelihood that respondents will engage in protective behavior. Understanding how protective behavior such as social distancing varies and the specific factors that mediate it may help with the design of epidemic control strategies.",0
Antiviral resistance during pandemic influenza: implications for stockpiling and drug use,"BACKGROUND: The anticipated extent of antiviral use during an influenza pandemic can have adverse consequences for the development of drug resistance and rationing of limited stockpiles. The strategic use of drugs is therefore a major public health concern in planning for effective pandemic responses. METHODS: We employed a mathematical model that includes both sensitive and resistant strains of a virus with pandemic potential, and applies antiviral drugs for treatment of clinical infections. Using estimated parameters in the published literature, the model was simulated for various sizes of stockpiles to evaluate the outcome of different antiviral strategies. RESULTS: We demonstrated that the emergence of highly transmissible resistant strains has no significant impact on the use of available stockpiles if treatment is maintained at low levels or the reproduction number of the sensitive strain is sufficiently high. However, moderate to high treatment levels can result in a more rapid depletion of stockpiles, leading to run-out, by promoting wide-spread drug resistance. We applied an antiviral strategy that delays the onset of aggressive treatment for a certain amount of time after the onset of the outbreak. Our results show that if high treatment levels are enforced too early during the outbreak, a second wave of infections can potentially occur with a substantially larger magnitude. However, a timely implementation of wide-scale treatment can prevent resistance spread in the population, and minimize the final size of the pandemic. CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that conservative treatment levels during the early stages of the outbreak, followed by a timely increase in the scale of drug-use, will offer an effective strategy to manage drug resistance in the population and avoid run-out. For a 1918-like strain, the findings suggest that pandemic plans should consider stockpiling antiviral drugs to cover at least 20% of the population.",0
Bioinformatics analysis of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus genome,"

This study presents a major advancement in bioinformatics analysis of rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) genomic data. With the current outbreak of this veterinary pathogen, there is an urgent need to understand its genetic features which have implications for understanding their evolution and adaptation. To address this challenge, we developed a novel strategy wherein high-throughput sequencing techniques were used to acquire RHDV isolates from different regions in Europe, followed by de novo assembly techniques for genome reconstruction. Subsequently, multiple bioinformatics analyses were applied to characterize the genome’s evolutionary dynamics thus establishing its phylogenetic relationships with other known viruses. Our findings highlight how RHDV evolved into distinct lineages that vary according to geographic locality and provide insight on various molecular signatures not previously reported for these viral sequences such as recombination events and motility originating from mobile genetic elements which contribute significantly to emergence of new virulent strains over time. This knowledge can be leveraged further gain precise information on infection pathways vital towards managing infections caused by emerging or re-emerging viruses like RHDV among European rabbits..",1
Peptide-Mediated Liposomal Drug Delivery System Targeting Tumor Blood Vessels in Anticancer Therapy,"Solid tumors are known to recruit new blood vessels to support their growth. Therefore, unique molecules expressed on tumor endothelial cells can function as targets for the antiangiogenic therapy of cancer. Current efforts are focusing on developing therapeutic agents capable of specifically targeting cancer cells and tumor-associated microenvironments including tumor blood vessels. These therapies hold the promise of high efficacy and low toxicity. One recognized strategy for improving the therapeutic effectiveness of conventional chemotherapeutics is to encapsulate anticancer drugs into targeting liposomes that bind to the cell surface receptors expressed on tumor-associated endothelial cells. These anti-angiogenic drug delivery systems could be used to target both tumor blood vessels as well as the tumor cells, themselves. This article reviews the mechanisms and advantages of various present and potential methods using peptide-conjugated liposomes to specifically destroy tumor blood vessels in anticancer therapy.",0
Responses of Human Endothelial Cells to Pathogenic and Non-Pathogenic Leptospira Species,"Leptospirosis is a widespread zoonotic infection that primarily affects residents of tropical regions, but causes infections in animals and humans in temperate regions as well. The agents of leptospirosis comprise several members of the genus Leptospira, which also includes non-pathogenic, saprophytic species. Leptospirosis can vary in severity from a mild, non-specific illness to severe disease that includes multi-organ failure and widespread endothelial damage and hemorrhage. To begin to investigate how pathogenic leptospires affect endothelial cells, we compared the responses of two endothelial cell lines to infection by pathogenic versus non-pathogenic leptospires. Microarray analyses suggested that pathogenic L. interrogans and non-pathogenic L. biflexa triggered changes in expression of genes whose products are involved in cellular architecture and interactions with the matrix, but that the changes were in opposite directions, with infection by L. biflexa primarily predicted to increase or maintain cell layer integrity, while L. interrogans lead primarily to changes predicted to disrupt cell layer integrity. Neither bacterial strain caused necrosis or apoptosis of the cells even after prolonged incubation. The pathogenic L. interrogans, however, did result in significant disruption of endothelial cell layers as assessed by microscopy and the ability of the bacteria to cross the cell layers. This disruption of endothelial layer integrity was abrogated by addition of the endothelial protective drug lisinopril at physiologically relevant concentrations. These results suggest that, through adhesion of L. interrogans to endothelial cells, the bacteria may disrupt endothelial barrier function, promoting dissemination of the bacteria and contributing to severe disease manifestations. In addition, supplementing antibiotic therapy with lisinopril or derivatives with endothelial protective activities may decrease the severity of leptospirosis.",0
Health workers' views on quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission and postnatal care for HIV-infected women and their children,"BACKGROUND: Prevention of mother-to-child transmission has been considered as not a simple intervention but a comprehensive set of interventions requiring capable health workers. Viet Nam's extensive health care system reaches the village level, but still HIV-infected mothers and children have received inadequate health care services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. We report here the health workers' perceptions on factors that lead to their failure to give good quality prevention of mother-to-child transmission services. METHODS: Semistructured interviews with 53 health workers and unstructured observations in nine health facilities in Hanoi were conducted. Selection of respondents was based on their function, position and experience in the development or implementation of prevention of mother-to-child transmission policies/programmes. RESULTS: Factors that lead to health workers' failure to give good quality services for prevention of mother-to-child transmission include their own fear of HIV infection; lack of knowledge on HIV and counselling skills; or high workloads and lack of staff; unavailability of HIV testing at commune level; shortage of antiretroviral drugs; and lack of operational guidelines. A negative attitude during counselling and provision of care, treating in a separate area and avoidance of providing service at all were seen by health workers as the result of fear of being infected, as well as distrust towards almost all HIV-infected patients because of the prevailing association with antisocial behaviours. Additionally, the fragmentation of the health care system into specialized vertical pillars, including a vertical programme for HIV/AIDS, is a major obstacle to providing a continuum of care. CONCLUSION: Many hospital staff were not being able to provide good care or were even unwilling to provide appropriate care for HIV-positive pregnant women The study suggests that the quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission service could be enhanced by improving communication and other skills of health workers, providing them with greater support and enhancing their motivation. Reduction of workload would also be important. Development of a practical strategy is needed to strengthen and adapt the referral system to meet the needs of patients.",0
Identification of a 37 kDa plant protein that interacts with the turnip mosaic potyvirus capsid protein using anti-idiotypic-antibodies," 

This article presents an innovative study on the biochemical identification of a 37 kDa plant protein, which was found to interact with turnip mosaic potyvirus (TuMV) capsid proteins. Using anti-idiotypic-antibodies produced by immunizing rabbits against the TuMV capsid, differential proteomics were employed to isolate and characterize the 37 kDa protein from infected samples. The ultimate goal is to gain insight into TuMV pathogenesis at the molecular level as well as increase understanding of virulence in plants for various diseases caused by related viruses. This study may serve as another approach towards recognizing and controlling such devastating diseases that cause significant economic losses worldwide.",1
How to deal with partially analyzable acts?,"

This study examines the prospect of dealing with partially analyzable acts from a theoretical standpoint. It is well established that modern businesses face a dilemma when interpreting ambiguous events, and it can be difficult to make meaningful distinctions between explicit activities, external influences, and unintended consequences. To offer an effective solution to this challenge, this paper investigates the concept of ‘meta-cognition’ - or learning about one's own thinking patterns - in order to help business leaders anticipate possible outcomes without prior knowledge or experience. This approach produces useful insights into how individuals might respond to different circumstances involving partial analytical information and offers potential strategies for managing uncertain environments. Finally, conclusions are drawn on how stakeholders can develop successful approaches for responding to incomplete data sets while balancing risk against returns.",1
"Identification, Characterization and Application of a G-Quadruplex Structured DNA Aptamer against Cancer Biomarker Protein Anterior Gradient Homolog 2","

Immunodetection of occult eosinophils in lung tissue biopsies may help predict survival in acute lung injury,"

Title: Immunodetection of Occult Eosinophils in Lung Tissue Biopsies May Help Predict Survival in Acute Lung Injury

The relationship between the presence of eosinophils, an important white blood cell type, and positive outcomes for patients suffering from acute lung injury (ALI), such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unclear. Recent discoveries have indicated that clinical symptoms alone are not adequate to predict patient mortality when dealing with ALIs. As a result, there is a need for novel biomarkers to identify which patients may benefit from early aggressive care upon diagnosis. In this study, we propose the use of immunohistochemistry combined with morphometry to detect occult eosinophils in paraffin embedded lung tissue biopsies taken immediately before death or discharge during treatment of ALIs in order elucidate their prognostic power. We hypothesize that increased numbers at moderate certainty levels indicate improved survival odds and higher quality-of-life after treatment due to early diagnosis leading to timely therapeutic interventions rather than delayed care caused by overly conservative diagnoses based on insufficient evidence. Our findings suggest the potential utility of intact and concealed eosinophile detection as an indicator for longevity prognostication among patients experiencing ALI complications involving ARDS and severe sepsis induced multi organ failure (MODS). This approach could provide doctors with information necessary for individualized prediction models allowing them faster response times regarding overall disease activity patterns and more accurate decision making processes potentially leading to earlier identification now recommended strategies aimed at improving patient outcomes across critical care settings worldwide..",1
Excess healthcare burden during 1918-1920 influenza pandemic in Taiwan: implications for post-pandemic preparedness,"BACKGROUND: It is speculated that the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus might fall into a seasonal pattern during the current post-pandemic period with more severe clinical presentation for high-risk groups identified during the 2009 pandemic. Hence the extent of likely excess healthcare needs during this period must be fully considered. We will make use of the historical healthcare record in Taiwan during and after the 1918 influenza pandemic to ascertain the scope of potential excess healthcare burden during the post-pandemic period. METHODS: To establish the healthcare needs after the initial wave in 1918, the yearly healthcare records (hospitalizations, outpatients, etc.) in Taiwan during 1918-1920 are compared with the corresponding data from the adjacent ""baseline"" years of 1916, 1917, 1921, and 1922 to estimate the excess healthcare burden during the initial outbreak in 1918 and in the years immediately after. RESULTS: In 1918 the number of public hospital outpatients exceeded the yearly average of the baseline years by 20.11% (95% CI: 16.43, 25.90), and the number of hospitalizations exceeded the corresponding yearly average of the baseline years by 12.20% (10.59, 14.38), while the excess number of patients treated by the public medics was statistically significant at 32.21% (28.48, 39.82) more than the yearly average of the baseline years. For 1920, only the excess number of hospitalizations was statistically significant at 19.83% (95% CI: 17.21, 23.38) more than the yearly average of the baseline years. CONCLUSIONS: Considerable extra burden with significant loss of lives was reported in 1918 by both the public medics system and the public hospitals. In comparison, only a substantial number of excess hospitalizations in the public hospitals was reported in 1920, indicating that the population was relatively unprepared for the first wave in 1918 and did not fully utilize the public hospitals. Moreover, comparatively low mortality was reported by the public hospitals and the public medics during the second wave in 1920 even though significantly more patients were hospitalized, suggesting that there had been substantially less fatal illnesses among the hospitalized patients during the second wave. Our results provide viable parameters for assessing healthcare needs for post-pandemic preparedness.",0
Proper Distance Metrics for Phylogenetic Analysis Using Complete Genomes without Sequence Alignment,A shortcoming of most correlation distance methods based on the composition vectors without alignment developed for phylogenetic analysis using complete genomes is that the “distances” are not proper distance metrics in the strict mathematical sense. In this paper we propose two new correlation-related distance metrics to replace the old one in our dynamical language approach. Four genome datasets are employed to evaluate the effects of this replacement from a biological point of view. We find that the two proper distance metrics yield trees with the same or similar topologies as/to those using the old “distance” and agree with the tree of life based on 16S rRNA in a majority of the basic branches. Hence the two proper correlation-related distance metrics proposed here improve our dynamical language approach for phylogenetic analysis.,0
Charge-Surrounded Pockets and Electrostatic Interactions with Small Ions Modulate the Activity of Retroviral Fusion Proteins,"Refolding of viral class-1 membrane fusion proteins from a native state to a trimer-of-hairpins structure promotes entry of viruses into cells. Here we present the structure of the bovine leukaemia virus transmembrane glycoprotein (TM) and identify a group of asparagine residues at the membrane-distal end of the trimer-of-hairpins that is strikingly conserved among divergent viruses. These asparagines are not essential for surface display of pre-fusogenic envelope. Instead, substitution of these residues dramatically disrupts membrane fusion. Our data indicate that, through electrostatic interactions with a chloride ion, the asparagine residues promote assembly and profoundly stabilize the fusion-active structures that are required for viral envelope-mediated membrane fusion. Moreover, the BLV TM structure also reveals a charge-surrounded hydrophobic pocket on the central coiled coil and interactions with basic residues that cluster around this pocket are critical to membrane fusion and form a target for peptide inhibitors of envelope function. Charge-surrounded pockets and electrostatic interactions with small ions are common among class-1 fusion proteins, suggesting that small molecules that specifically target such motifs should prevent assembly of the trimer-of-hairpins and be of value as therapeutic inhibitors of viral entry.",0
"Prospective study of avian influenza H9 infection in commercial poultry farms of Punjab Province and Islamabad Capital Territory, Pakistan","

This prospective study seeks to evaluate the prevalence of avian influenza H9 infection in commercial poultry farms of Punjab Province and Islamabad Capital Territory, Pakistan. Avian influenza (AI) is a growing public health concern due to its potential for pandemic spread among humans and its economic impact on global food security. Since avian-human transmissions have previously been reported, particularly through contact with infected birds or bird products, it is necessary to survey the risk factors associated with AI outbreaks in order to protect animal and human health. In view of this, our research focuses specifically on areas where there are large numbers of domestic fowls; namely Punjab Province and Islamabad Capital Territory (ICT). This study will use PCR technique for virus detection along with molecular characterization from 100 samples from domestic poultry originating within 11 districts. The aim of this research is not only understanding prevalence pertaining to AI H9 infection in both areas but also determining identified putative risk factors that might contribute towards higher frequency rate in one area as compared to other. This article aims at comparing data collected from two urban/suburban contexts regarding AI transmission intensity among bred fowls employed at commercial farm settings operating under varied husbandry practices which could be associated with high risk for exposure and harbouring potential sources for viral transmission risks within each region studied making this project potentially pivotal in helping understand such risks better than before.",1
Translation Elongation Factor 1A Facilitates the Assembly of the Tombusvirus Replicase and Stimulates Minus-Strand Synthesis,"Replication of plus-strand RNA viruses depends on host factors that are recruited into viral replicase complexes. Previous studies showed that eukaryotic translation elongation factor (eEF1A) is one of the resident host proteins in the highly purified tombusvirus replicase complex. Using a random library of eEF1A mutants, we identified one mutant that decreased and three mutants that increased Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) replication in a yeast model host. Additional in vitro assays with whole cell extracts prepared from yeast strains expressing the eEF1A mutants demonstrated several functions for eEF1A in TBSV replication: facilitating the recruitment of the viral RNA template into the replicase complex; the assembly of the viral replicase complex; and enhancement of the minus-strand synthesis by promoting the initiation step. These roles for eEF1A are separate from its canonical role in host and viral protein translation, emphasizing critical functions for this abundant cellular protein during TBSV replication.",0
"The 21st International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine, Brussels, Belgium, 20-23 March 2001","The 21st International Symposium on Intensive Care and Emergency Medicine was dominated by the results of recent clinical trials in sepsis and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The promise of extracorporeal liver replacement therapy and noninvasive ventilation were other areas of interest. Ethical issues also received attention.

Early transcriptional response in the jejunum of germ-free piglets after oral infection with virulent rotavirus,"Germ-free piglets were orally infected with virulent rotavirus to collect jejunal mucosal scrapings at 12 and 18 hours post infection (two piglets per time point). IFN-gamma mRNA expression was stimulated in the mucosa of all four infected piglets, indicating that they all responded to the rotavirus infection. RNA pools prepared from two infected piglets were used to compare whole mucosal gene expression at 12 and 18 hpi to expression in uninfected germ-free piglets (n = 3) using a porcine intestinal cDNA microarray. Microarray analysis identified 13 down-regulated and 17 up-regulated genes. Northern blot analysis of a selected group of genes confirmed the data of the microarray. Genes were functionally clustered in interferon-regulated genes, proliferation/differentiation genes, apoptosis genes, cytoskeleton genes, signal transduction genes, and enterocyte digestive, absorptive, and transport genes. Down-regulation of the transport gene cluster reflected in part the loss of rotavirus-infected enterocytes from the villous tips. Data mining suggested that several genes were regulated in lower- or mid-villus immature enterocytes and goblet cells, probably to support repair of the damaged epithelial cell layer at the villous tips. Furthermore, up-regulation was observed for IFN-γ induced guanylate binding protein 2, a protein that effectively inhibited VSV and EMCV replication in vitro (Arch Virol 150:1213–1220, 2005). This protein may play a role in the small intestine’s innate defense against enteric viruses like rotavirus.

Survival of Influenza A(H1N1) on Materials Found in Households: Implications for Infection Control,"

This study aims to provide insight into the implications of influenza A(H1N1) survival on materials commonly found in households and its potential impact upon infection control. Literature suggests that prior outbreaking viruses, such as SARS-CoV-2 and Influenza A (H5N8), may remain viable outside a human host for extended periods of time on porous surfaces such as fabrics and carpets. The purpose of this research is to examine whether Influenza A(H1N1) can survive similarly on commonly occurring household materials, through an exploration of the virus’s persistence times under various conditions. A secondary objective will be assessing the effectiveness of preventative measures in limiting its transmission capacity via contact with these materials. In preparing analyses from experimental data generated from laboratory settings, we look forward to providing valuable information concerning best practices for reducing the risk of H1N1 related infections within domestic environments as well as consideration for further public health guidance development relative to other respiratory illnesses spread by similar mechanisms.

A molecular clamp ensures allosteric coordination of peptidyltransfer and ligand binding to the ribosomal A-site,"Although the ribosome is mainly comprised of rRNA and many of its critical functions occur through RNA–RNA interactions, distinct domains of ribosomal proteins also participate in switching the ribosome between different conformational/functional states. Prior studies demonstrated that two extended domains of ribosomal protein L3 form an allosteric switch between the pre- and post-translocational states. Missing was an explanation for how the movements of these domains are communicated among the ribosome's functional centers. Here, a third domain of L3 called the basic thumb, that protrudes roughly perpendicular from the W-finger and is nestled in the center of a cagelike structure formed by elements from three separate domains of the large subunit rRNA is investigated. Mutagenesis of basically charged amino acids of the basic thumb to alanines followed by detailed analyses suggests that it acts as a molecular clamp, playing a role in allosterically communicating the ribosome's tRNA occupancy status to the elongation factor binding region and the peptidyltransferase center, facilitating coordination of their functions through the elongation cycle. The observation that these mutations affected translational fidelity, virus propagation and cell growth demonstrates how small structural changes at the atomic scale can propagate outward to broadly impact the biology of cell.",0
"The GLEaMviz computational tool, a publicly available software to explore realistic epidemic spreading scenarios at the global scale","BACKGROUND: Computational models play an increasingly important role in the assessment and control of public health crises, as demonstrated during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. Much research has been done in recent years in the development of sophisticated data-driven models for realistic computer-based simulations of infectious disease spreading. However, only a few computational tools are presently available for assessing scenarios, predicting epidemic evolutions, and managing health emergencies that can benefit a broad audience of users including policy makers and health institutions. RESULTS: We present ""GLEaMviz"", a publicly available software system that simulates the spread of emerging human-to-human infectious diseases across the world. The GLEaMviz tool comprises three components: the client application, the proxy middleware, and the simulation engine. The latter two components constitute the GLEaMviz server. The simulation engine leverages on the Global Epidemic and Mobility (GLEaM) framework, a stochastic computational scheme that integrates worldwide high-resolution demographic and mobility data to simulate disease spread on the global scale. The GLEaMviz design aims at maximizing flexibility in defining the disease compartmental model and configuring the simulation scenario; it allows the user to set a variety of parameters including: compartment-specific features, transition values, and environmental effects. The output is a dynamic map and a corresponding set of charts that quantitatively describe the geo-temporal evolution of the disease. The software is designed as a client-server system. The multi-platform client, which can be installed on the user's local machine, is used to set up simulations that will be executed on the server, thus avoiding specific requirements for large computational capabilities on the user side. CONCLUSIONS: The user-friendly graphical interface of the GLEaMviz tool, along with its high level of detail and the realism of its embedded modeling approach, opens up the platform to simulate realistic epidemic scenarios. These features make the GLEaMviz computational tool a convenient teaching/training tool as well as a first step toward the development of a computational tool aimed at facilitating the use and exploitation of computational models for the policy making and scenario analysis of infectious disease outbreaks.",0
In Vitro and In Vivo Studies Identify Important Features of Dengue Virus pr-E Protein Interactions,"Flaviviruses bud into the endoplasmic reticulum and are transported through the secretory pathway, where the mildly acidic environment triggers particle rearrangement and allows furin processing of the prM protein to pr and M. The peripheral pr peptide remains bound to virus at low pH and inhibits virus-membrane interaction. Upon exocytosis, the release of pr at neutral pH completes virus maturation to an infectious particle. Together this evidence suggests that pr may shield the flavivirus fusion protein E from the low pH environment of the exocytic pathway. Here we developed an in vitro system to reconstitute the interaction of dengue virus (DENV) pr with soluble truncated E proteins. At low pH recombinant pr bound to both monomeric and dimeric forms of E and blocked their membrane insertion. Exogenous pr interacted with mature infectious DENV and specifically inhibited virus fusion and infection. Alanine substitution of E H244, a highly conserved histidine residue in the pr-E interface, blocked pr-E interaction and reduced release of DENV virus-like particles. Folding, membrane insertion and trimerization of the H244A mutant E protein were preserved, and particle release could be partially rescued by neutralization of the low pH of the secretory pathway. Thus, pr acts to silence flavivirus fusion activity during virus secretion, and this function can be separated from the chaperone activity of prM. The sequence conservation of key residues involved in the flavivirus pr-E interaction suggests that this protein-protein interface may be a useful target for broad-spectrum inhibitors.",0
"Herbal Products: Benefits, Limits, and Applications in Chronic Liver Disease","

Herbal remedies have been used for centuries to treat various ailments, but their efficacy and safety remain largely unknown. This paper provides an in-depth review of the current evidence on the benefits, limitations, and applications of herbal products in chronic liver disease. An analysis of existing studies has revealed a wide range of beneficial effects on symptoms commonly associated with chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis C virus infection and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Furthermore, there are some potential limitations to the use of herbal products including an unreliable standardization process and lack of regulation regarding toxicity levels. Finally, this article proposes several practical strategies based on evidence-based medicine to apply these products effectively while minimizing adverse events. In summary, although further clinical trials are needed to further illuminate possible effects from using herbal therapies for treating chronic liver disease, enough data exist to indicate that they may be a valid option for reducing symptoms within certain conditions.",1
Complex dynamic behavior in a viral model with state feedback control strategies,"

This paper presents an investigation into the behavior of a viral model under state feedback control strategies. Through a combination of mathematical analysis and numerical simulations, this work examines how this type of model may respond to different types of input variables and deliver varying levels of output when subjected to such controls. The aim is to gain greater understanding into the characteristics behind complex dynamic behavior in response to active regulation by external factors. An evaluation on both forecasting and real-time reactions will be conducted with further emphasis on emergent high level features which manifest as part of these operations. Furthermore, it will explore implications for future research that rely upon accurate predictions regarding these models' behavior under various conditions enabled by external regulators.",1
Attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis-mediated RNAi targeted to conserved regions against foot-and-mouth disease virus in guinea pigs and swine,"In this study, specific sequences within three genes (3D, VP4 and 2B) of the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) genome were determined to be effective RNAi targets. These sequences are highly conserved among different serotype viruses based on sequence analysis. Small interfering RNA (siRNA)-expressing plasmids (p3D-NT19, p3D-NT56, pVP4-NT19, pVP4-NT65 and p2B-NT25) were constructed to express siRNA targeting 3D, VP4 and 2B, respectively. The antiviral potential of these siRNA for various FMDV isolates was investigated in baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells and suckling mice. The results show that these siRNA inhibited virus yield 10- to 300-fold for different FMDV isolates of serotype O and serotype Asia I at 48 h post infection in BHK-21 cells compared to control cells. In suckling mice, p3D-NT56 and p2B-NT25 delayed the death of mice. Twenty percent to 40% of the animals that received a single siRNA dose survived 5 days post infection with serotype O or serotype Asia I. We used an attenuated Salmonella choleraesuis (C500) vaccine strain, to carry the plasmid that expresses siRNA directed against the polymerase gene 3D (p3D-NT56) of FMDV. We used guinea pigs to evaluate the inhibitory effects of recombinant S. cho (p3D-NT56/S. cho) on FMDV infection. The results show that 80% of guinea pigs inoculated with 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho and challenged 36 h later with 50 ID(50) of homologous FMDV were protected. We also measured the antiviral activity of p3D-NT56/S. cho in swine. The results indicate that 100% of the animals treated with 5 × 10(9) CFU of p3D-NT56/S. cho were protected in 9 days.",0
Predicting Biological Functions of Compounds Based on Chemical-Chemical Interactions,"

This paper presents a novel strategy for predicting biological functions of compounds based on chemical-chemical interactions. An algorithm, which is defined as “functional weight”, was developed to leverage the relationship between two molecules in order to identify their potential gene associated activities. This approach provides an effective way of computing molecular properties and eliminates the need for traditional experimentation methods that are costly, labor intensive and time consuming. The algorithm was tested against a dataset containing known bioactivity relationships among targets and various compound structures along with experimental verification by High-throughput Screening (HTS). Results showed a statistically significant correlation between predicted activity scores and actual activity labels in more than 80% of cases; thus proving highly reliable insights into possible intermolecular associations with respect to biological functions even in low data settings. In summary, this research demonstrates that functional weight offers robust predictions regarding compound–target interactions thereby providing useful guidance for drug discovery workflows at scale using fewer resources emphasizing its potential application as a predictive tool across different industrial sectors.",1
Relevant Cytokines in the Management of Community-Acquired Pneumonia," 

This article provides an overview of the role of relevant cytokines in the medical management of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). It examines current evidence from recent studies regarding the role of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines as markers for severity predictors, risk factors associated with mortality rate, treatment efficacy, and potential treatments for CAP. To do so it includes clinical trials conducted to evaluate the utility and safety of new therapies targeting these cytokines. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for diagnosis, prognosis assessment and choice or combination therapy outcomes. In conclusion, based on the latest scientific evidence presented herein this paper concludes that a better understanding and appropriate modulation/management at these specific cytokine levels looks promising as one strategy to improve patient outcomes in CAP management.",1
Polyvalent DNA Vaccines Expressing HA Antigens of H5N1 Influenza Viruses with an Optimized Leader Sequence Elicit Cross-Protective Antibody Responses,"

This paper explores the efficacy of a novel polyvalent DNA vaccine, expressing HA antigens derived from multiple H5N1 influenza viruses. A leader sequence optimization technique is utilized to enhance cross-protective antibody responses elicited by immune system interaction with these antigenic components. Immune cell receptor assays and submicron particle image analysis are used in conjunction to evaluate the success of this approach. Results indicate that optimized leader sequences can significantly improve immunogenicity by increasing both antigen presentation and exposure to infection-induced factors resulting in improved protective capabilities as verified through both macroscopic scale and cellular level studies. Cross protection was not only induced but also sustained for long durations post exposure providing highly effective barrier against potential influenza outbreaks.",1
Distinct Regulation of Host Responses by ERK and JNK MAP Kinases in Swine Macrophages Infected with Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Influenza Virus,"

This paper investigates the distinct regulation of host responses in swine macrophages infected with pandemic (H1N1)-2009 influenza virus. Distinct but coordinated signalling pathways, comprised of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), are important instigators of response to pathogenic insults. In this study, we highlighted how differentially regulated ERK and JNK MAP Kinase expression levels correlated with gene transcripts related to innate immune response within a population of swine macrophages challenged by H1N1 2009 Influenza Virus. Through qPCR analysis, immunofluorescence assays as well as inhibition studies using pharmacological LY294002 inhibitors for ERK/MAPKinase activation variation was determined. Results showed that both ERK and JNK likely have a pleotropic role in the remission or progression of sows’ macrophage immune responses to H1N12009 Infection by regulating cellular proliferation, cytokines production and apoptosis properties upon infection thereby presenting opportunities for functional health maintenance strategies targeting these two individual types of MAP Kinases  against other viral pathogens leading up to future promising treatments for diseases caused by such viruses including Swine Flu( HAN 1).",1
Porcine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and analysis of their peptide-binding specificities,"

This study focuses on the Porcine major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules and aims to analyze their peptide-binding specificities. The porcine MHC plays an indispensable role in antigenic presentation and is a crucial factor in swine health and disease resistance. This article will illuminate the complexity of this system by investigating its broad range of potential ligands that may aid in understanding the peculiarity of immune recognition within different MHC alleles. To tackle this issue, diverse bioinformatic tools and advanced publicly available databases were implemented via comprehensive peptide library immunoprecipitations combined with tandem mass spectrometry for deducing putative binding motifs for various MHC class I alleles sourced from pigs representing multiple breeds originating from Western countries as well as China. These detailed insights into class I-restricted antigen processing are essential to augment our understanding of swine health, stress conditions, infectious diseases, and tumor development – all facets which might be optimized through proper manipulations of such diversified immunity systems at the molecular level.",1
The Transmembrane Domain of CEACAM1-4S Is a Determinant of Anchorage Independent Growth and Tumorigenicity,"

This study investigates the molecular parameters responsible for modulating cell adhesion and tumorigenicity in colon cancer cells expressing different variants of CEACAM1. The authors demonstrate that amino acid sequence changes within the transmembrane domain of four somatic variant CEACAM1-4s regulate anchorage independent growth phenotypes, providing a new insight into understanding cellular behavior and its potential implications in tumor invasion. Alterations to integral membrane composition can be an important contributor towards aberrant transformed traits such as proliferation, invasiveness, motility and altered adhesive responses that contribute to tumor progression. This multi-parametric approach provides valuable knowledge toward designing more specific therapeutic strategies targeting unequal distribution of receptors on the surface membrane – hence reducing tumor cell expansion with minimal detrimental side effects. Overall, this research adds to our current understanding of the functional genetic components that influence carcinogenesis through regulating essential pathways associated with anchor-independent cell behaviour thus offering renewed hope for better prognosis outcomes for colorectal cancer patients in need.",1
Clinical Relevance and Discriminatory Value of Elevated Liver Aminotransferase Levels for Dengue Severity,"

In recent years, dengue has become an increasingly prevalent and life-threatening infection due to the globalization of vector-borne diseases. The severity of dengue can range from asymptomatic to fatal cases. Elevated liver aminotransferase levels are found in both mild and severe forms of the virus and may occur prior to or at the same time as haemorrhagic complications during clinical progression. In this study, we sought to evaluate the discriminatory value of serum alanine transaminase (ALT) for distinguishing between mild and moderate/severe cases among individuals with dengue infection in a northeastern Brazilian city with an endemic burden. Additionally, we aimed to identify potential associations between ALT elevation and disease course by comparing these values in patients hospitalized during their primary or secondary febrile episode. Our results revealed that elevated ALT levels significantly increased with increasing biological severity, suggesting a potential relationship between degree of hepatic involvement and more severe presentations linked with higher mortality rates associated with dengue infections worldwide.

Rapid detection of pandemic influenza in the presence of seasonal influenza,"BACKGROUND: Key to the control of pandemic influenza are surveillance systems that raise alarms rapidly and sensitively. In addition, they must minimise false alarms during a normal influenza season. We develop a method that uses historical syndromic influenza data from the existing surveillance system 'SERVIS' (Scottish Enhanced Respiratory Virus Infection Surveillance) for influenza-like illness (ILI) in Scotland. METHODS: We develop an algorithm based on the weekly case ratio (WCR) of reported ILI cases to generate an alarm for pandemic influenza. From the seasonal influenza data from 13 Scottish health boards, we estimate the joint probability distribution of the country-level WCR and the number of health boards showing synchronous increases in reported influenza cases over the previous week. Pandemic cases are sampled with various case reporting rates from simulated pandemic influenza infections and overlaid with seasonal SERVIS data from 2001 to 2007. Using this combined time series we test our method for speed of detection, sensitivity and specificity. Also, the 2008-09 SERVIS ILI cases are used for testing detection performances of the three methods with a real pandemic data. RESULTS: We compare our method, based on our simulation study, to the moving-average Cumulative Sums (Mov-Avg Cusum) and ILI rate threshold methods and find it to be more sensitive and rapid. For 1% case reporting and detection specificity of 95%, our method is 100% sensitive and has median detection time (MDT) of 4 weeks while the Mov-Avg Cusum and ILI rate threshold methods are, respectively, 97% and 100% sensitive with MDT of 5 weeks. At 99% specificity, our method remains 100% sensitive with MDT of 5 weeks. Although the threshold method maintains its sensitivity of 100% with MDT of 5 weeks, sensitivity of Mov-Avg Cusum declines to 92% with increased MDT of 6 weeks. For a two-fold decrease in the case reporting rate (0.5%) and 99% specificity, the WCR and threshold methods, respectively, have MDT of 5 and 6 weeks with both having sensitivity close to 100% while the Mov-Avg Cusum method can only manage sensitivity of 77% with MDT of 6 weeks. However, the WCR and Mov-Avg Cusum methods outperform the ILI threshold method by 1 week in retrospective detection of the 2009 pandemic in Scotland. CONCLUSIONS: While computationally and statistically simple to implement, the WCR algorithm is capable of raising alarms, rapidly and sensitively, for influenza pandemics against a background of seasonal influenza. Although the algorithm was developed using the SERVIS data, it has the capacity to be used at other geographic scales and for different disease systems where buying some early extra time is critical.",0
"Human immunome, bioinformatic analyses using HLA supermotifs and the parasite genome, binding assays, studies of human T cell responses, and immunization of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice including novel adjuvants provide a foundation for HLA-A03 restricted CD8(+)T cell epitope based, adjuvanted vaccine protective against Toxoplasma gondii","BACKGROUND: Toxoplasmosis causes loss of life, cognitive and motor function, and sight. A vaccine is greatly needed to prevent this disease. The purpose of this study was to use an immmunosense approach to develop a foundation for development of vaccines to protect humans with the HLA-A03 supertype. Three peptides had been identified with high binding scores for HLA-A03 supertypes using bioinformatic algorhythms, high measured binding affinity for HLA-A03 supertype molecules, and ability to elicit IFN-γ production by human HLA-A03 supertype peripheral blood CD8(+ )T cells from seropositive but not seronegative persons. RESULTS: Herein, when these peptides were administered with the universal CD4(+)T cell epitope PADRE (AKFVAAWTLKAAA) and formulated as lipopeptides, or administered with GLA-SE either alone, or with Pam(2)Cys added, we found we successfully created preparations that induced IFN-γ and reduced parasite burden in HLA-A*1101(an HLA-A03 supertype allele) transgenic mice. GLA-SE is a novel emulsified synthetic TLR4 ligand that is known to facilitate development of T Helper 1 cell (TH1) responses. Then, so our peptides would include those expressed in tachyzoites, bradyzoites and sporozoites from both Type I and II parasites, we used our approaches which had identified the initial peptides. We identified additional peptides using bioinformatics, binding affinity assays, and study of responses of HLA-A03 human cells. Lastly, we found that immunization of HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice with all the pooled peptides administered with PADRE, GLA-SE, and Pam(2)Cys is an effective way to elicit IFN-γ producing CD8(+ )splenic T cells and protection. Immunizations included the following peptides together: KSFKDILPK (SAG1(224-232)); AMLTAFFLR (GRA6(164-172)); RSFKDLLKK (GRA7(134-142)); STFWPCLLR (SAG2C(13-21)); SSAYVFSVK((SPA250-258)); and AVVSLLRLLK(SPA(89-98)). This immunization elicited robust protection, measured as reduced parasite burden using a luciferase transfected parasite, luciferin, this novel, HLA transgenic mouse model, and imaging with a Xenogen camera. CONCLUSIONS: Toxoplasma gondii peptides elicit HLA-A03 restricted, IFN-γ producing, CD8(+ )T cells in humans and mice. These peptides administered with adjuvants reduce parasite burden in HLA-A*1101 transgenic mice. This work provides a foundation for immunosense based vaccines. It also defines novel adjuvants for newly identified peptides for vaccines to prevent toxoplasmosis in those with HLA-A03 supertype alleles.",0
Inhibition of Lassa Virus Glycoprotein Cleavage and Multicycle Replication by Site 1 Protease-Adapted α(1)-Antitrypsin Variants,"BACKGROUND: Proteolytic processing of the Lassa virus envelope glycoprotein precursor GP-C by the host proprotein convertase site 1 protease (S1P) is a prerequisite for the incorporation of the subunits GP-1 and GP-2 into viral particles and, hence, essential for infectivity and virus spread. Therefore, we tested in this study the concept of using S1P as a target to block efficient virus replication. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDING: We demonstrate that stable cell lines inducibly expressing S1P-adapted α(1)-antitrypsin variants inhibit the proteolytic maturation of GP-C. Introduction of the S1P recognition motifs RRIL and RRLL into the reactive center loop of α(1)-antitrypsin resulted in abrogation of GP-C processing by endogenous S1P to a similar level observed in S1P-deficient cells. Moreover, S1P-specific α(1)-antitrypsins significantly inhibited replication and spread of a replication-competent recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus expressing the Lassa virus glycoprotein GP as well as authentic Lassa virus. Inhibition of viral replication correlated with the ability of the different α(1)-antitrypsin variants to inhibit the processing of the Lassa virus glycoprotein precursor. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our data suggest that glycoprotein cleavage by S1P is a promising target for the development of novel anti-arenaviral strategies.",0
Dynamics and Control of Diseases in Networks with Community Structure,"The dynamics of infectious diseases spread via direct person-to-person transmission (such as influenza, smallpox, HIV/AIDS, etc.) depends on the underlying host contact network. Human contact networks exhibit strong community structure. Understanding how such community structure affects epidemics may provide insights for preventing the spread of disease between communities by changing the structure of the contact network through pharmaceutical or non-pharmaceutical interventions. We use empirical and simulated networks to investigate the spread of disease in networks with community structure. We find that community structure has a major impact on disease dynamics, and we show that in networks with strong community structure, immunization interventions targeted at individuals bridging communities are more effective than those simply targeting highly connected individuals. Because the structure of relevant contact networks is generally not known, and vaccine supply is often limited, there is great need for efficient vaccination algorithms that do not require full knowledge of the network. We developed an algorithm that acts only on locally available network information and is able to quickly identify targets for successful immunization intervention. The algorithm generally outperforms existing algorithms when vaccine supply is limited, particularly in networks with strong community structure. Understanding the spread of infectious diseases and designing optimal control strategies is a major goal of public health. Social networks show marked patterns of community structure, and our results, based on empirical and simulated data, demonstrate that community structure strongly affects disease dynamics. These results have implications for the design of control strategies.",0
Lung Function and Organ Dysfunctions in 178 Patients Requiring Mechanical Ventilation During The 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) Pandemic,"

This article presents a unique insight into the relationship between lung function and organ dysfunctions in 178 patients requiring mechanical ventilation during the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. These patients were treated at 24 medical centers within 6 countries, highlighting the broad-reaching impact of this virus strain internationally. The authors investigated factors such as age, gender and underlying health conditions to understand their effect on respiratory and multiorgan dysfunction. They determined that those aged 40+ had significantly higher rates of multiorgan dysfunction than younger patients, and male genders had higher rates of respiratory failure preceding organ dysfunction compared to females. Furthermore they suggest that infections like influenza A can put strain on organs other than the lungs both directly via infection or indirectly via inflammatory mechanisms. Ultimately they concluded that all contributing risk factors need to be considered when determining treatment options for individuals with preexisting conditions susceptible to exacerbated complications from highly contagious viruses such as Influenza A H1N1 in order to provide optimal care.",1
Transmission Dynamics and Prospects for the Elimination of Canine Rabies,"Rabies has been eliminated from domestic dog populations in Western Europe and North America, but continues to kill many thousands of people throughout Africa and Asia every year. A quantitative understanding of transmission dynamics in domestic dog populations provides critical information to assess whether global elimination of canine rabies is possible. We report extensive observations of individual rabid animals in Tanzania and generate a uniquely detailed analysis of transmission biology, which explains important epidemiological features, including the level of variation in epidemic trajectories. We found that the basic reproductive number for rabies, R(0), is very low in our study area in rural Africa (∼1.2) and throughout its historic global range (<2). This finding provides strong support for the feasibility of controlling endemic canine rabies by vaccination, even near wildlife areas with large wild carnivore populations. However, we show that rapid turnover of domestic dog populations has been a major obstacle to successful control in developing countries, thus regular pulse vaccinations will be required to maintain population-level immunity between campaigns. Nonetheless our analyses suggest that with sustained, international commitment, global elimination of rabies from domestic dog populations, the most dangerous vector to humans, is a realistic goal.",0
ProCAT: a data analysis approach for protein microarrays,"Protein microarrays provide a versatile method for the analysis of many protein biochemical activities. Existing DNA microarray analytical methods do not translate to protein microarrays due to differences between the technologies. Here we report a new approach, ProCAT, which corrects for background bias and spatial artifacts, identifies significant signals, filters nonspecific spots, and normalizes the resulting signal to protein abundance. ProCAT provides a powerful and flexible new approach for analyzing many types of protein microarrays.",0
Apoptotic signals induce specific degradation of ribosomal RNA in yeast,"Organisms exposed to reactive oxygen species, generated endogenously during respiration or by environmental conditions, undergo oxidative stress. Stress response can either repair the damage or activate one of the programmed cell death (PCD) mechanisms, for example apoptosis, and finally end in cell death. One striking characteristic, which accompanies apoptosis in both vertebrates and yeast, is a fragmentation of cellular DNA and mammalian apoptosis is often associated with degradation of different RNAs. We show that in yeast exposed to stimuli known to induce apoptosis, such as hydrogen peroxide, acetic acid, hyperosmotic stress and ageing, two large subunit ribosomal RNAs, 25S and 5.8S, became extensively degraded with accumulation of specific intermediates that differ slightly depending on cell death conditions. This process is most likely endonucleolytic, is correlated with stress response, and depends on the mitochondrial respiratory status: rRNA is less susceptible to degradation in respiring cells with functional defence against oxidative stress. In addition, RNA fragmentation is independent of two yeast apoptotic factors, metacaspase Yca1 and apoptosis-inducing factor Aif1, but it relies on the apoptotic chromatin condensation induced by histone H2B modifications. These data describe a novel phenotype for certain stress- and ageing-related PCD pathways in yeast.",0
Interaction of the HIV-1 frameshift signal with the ribosome,"Ribosomal frameshifting on viral RNAs relies on the mechanical properties of structural elements, often pseudoknots and more rarely stem-loops, that are unfolded by the ribosome during translation. In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 type B a long hairpin containing a three-nucleotide bulge is responsible for efficient frameshifting. This three-nucleotide bulge separates the hairpin in two domains: an unstable lower stem followed by a GC-rich upper stem. Toeprinting and chemical probing assays suggest that a hairpin-like structure is retained when ribosomes, initially bound at the slippery sequence, were allowed multiple EF-G catalyzed translocation cycles. However, while the upper stem remains intact the lower stem readily melts. After the first, and single step of translocation of deacylated tRNA to the 30 S P site, movement of the mRNA stem-loop in the 5′ direction is halted, which is consistent with the notion that the downstream secondary structure resists unfolding. Mechanical stretching of the hairpin using optical tweezers only allows clear identification of unfolding of the upper stem at a force of 12.8 ± 1.0 pN. This suggests that the lower stem is unstable and may indeed readily unfold in the presence of a translocating ribosome.",0
Reliability and External Validity of AMSTAR in Assessing Quality of TCM Systematic Reviews,"

This article seeks to evaluate the reliability and external validity of an Assessment Methodology for Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) in order to assess the quality of Traditional Chinese Medicine systematic reviews. Studies show that evaluating TCM research has led to a great challenge due to its inherent characteristics, including abundance elements and various types of bias. Thus, this study will focus on employing AMSTAR as tool for assessing the quality of systematic reviews related to traditional Chinese medicine as well as exploring its performance in establishing standard operating procedures for future studies. We aim at uncovering any discrepancies or limitations between various methods employed by researchers when using and applying AMSTAR tools. Our findings could be useful for validating study results countenanced with established guidelines about reliable assessment protocols, further enhancing our confidence in these assessments which would benefit both clinical practice and research areas alike.",1
"Murphy's law—if anything can go wrong, it will: Problems in phage electron microscopy","

This article assesses the application of Murphy's law—if anything can go wrong, it will—in limiting the effectiveness of phage electron microscopy (PEM). Using an exhaustive survey, sample data was collected and analysed to evaluate problems such as resolution limits due to carrier waves, distortions caused by environmental factors and particle collisions. In addition, this paper offers insight into techniques for avoiding or mitigating complications arising from these issues. The results demonstrate that common observations in PEM operations are strongly associated with Murphy’s Law being exercised. This research rounds out current understanding on how to best leverage advantages available in PEM systems while complying with Murphy's law so clinical decisions supported by PEM imaging do not become invalidated unexpectedly.",1
Reconstructing disease outbreaks from genetic data: a graph approach,"

This article presents the potential of graph databases to reconstruct outbreaks of diseases caused by viruses and other microorganisms, as well as the associated genetic data. In recent years, genomic technologies have enabled disease surveillance systems to identify and track pathogens quickly and accurately. Statistics of epidemiological tracebacks indicate that up to 70% of infectious episodes are due to undetected or incompletely monitored causes. Effective mapping between epidemic patterns and underlying virus sequences can offer significant insights for public health decisions. We propose a new an innovative approach using graph models which leverage the dynamic characteristics from traditional methods designed for this purpose; but with improved memory requirements enabling multiple simultaneous analyses in similar time constraints. This paper discusses our findings on actual datasets from online resources, comparing traditional methods such as pathogen tree inference algorithms (PTIAs) with novel strategies utilising temporal graphs generated from phylogenetic trees instead – further assisted by identifying recombination events when applicable in virus samples. Finally we discuss limitations experienced during implementation along with suggestions for future work to further develop these techniques towards real-time data management applications in outbreak prediction scenarios",1
NSs Encoded by Groundnut Bud Necrosis Virus Is a Bifunctional Enzyme,"Groundnut bud necrosis virus (GBNV), a member of genus Tospovirus in the family Bunyaviridae, infects a large number of leguminosae and solanaceae plants in India. With a view to elucidate the function of nonstructural protein, NSs encoded by the small RNA genome (S RNA), the NSs protein of GBNV- tomato (Karnataka) [1] was over-expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. The purified rNSs protein exhibited an RNA stimulated NTPase activity. Further, this activity was metal ion dependent and was inhibited by adenosine 5′ (β, γ imido) triphosphate, an ATP analog. The rNSs could also hydrolyze dATP. Interestingly, in addition to the NTPase and dATPase activities, the rNSs exhibited ATP independent 5′ RNA/DNA phosphatase activity that was completely inhibited by AMP. The 5′ α phosphate could be removed from ssDNA, ssRNA, dsDNA and dsRNA thus confirming that rNSs has a novel 5′ α phosphatase activity. K189A mutation in the Walker motif A (GxxxxGKT) resulted in complete loss of ATPase activity, but the 5′ phosphatase activity was unaffected. On the other hand, D159A mutation in the Walker motif B (DExx) resulted in partial loss of both the activities. These results demonstrate for the first time that NSs is a bifunctional enzyme, which could participate in viral movement, replication or in suppression of the host defense mechanism.",0
Hepatitis Associated Aplastic Anemia: A review,"Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is an uncommon but distinct variant of aplastic anemia in which pancytopenia appears two to three months after an acute attack of hepatitis. HAAA occurs most frequently in young male children and is lethal if leave untreated. The etiology of this syndrome is proposed to be attributed to various hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses. Several hepatitis viruses such as HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV and HGV have been associated with this set of symptoms. Viruses other than the hepatitis viruses such as parvovirus B19, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein bar virus, Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV) and non-A-E hepatitis virus (unknown viruses) has also been documented to develop the syndrome. Considerable evidences including the clinical features, severe imbalance of the T cell immune system and effective response to immunosuppressive therapy strongly present HAAA as an immune mediated mechanism. However, no association of HAAA has been found with blood transfusions, drugs and toxins. Besides hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses and immunopathogenesis phenomenon as causative agents of the disorder, telomerase mutation, a genetic factor has also been predisposed for the development of aplastic anemia. Diagnosis includes clinical manifestations, blood profiling, viral serological markers testing, immune functioning and bone marrow hypocellularity examination. Patients presenting the features of HAAA have been mostly treated with bone marrow or hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA matched donor, and if not available then by immunosuppressive therapy. New therapeutic approaches involve the administration of steroids especially the glucocorticoids to augment the immunosuppressive therapy response. Pancytopenia following an episode of acute hepatitis response better to hematopoietic cell transplantation than immunosuppressive therapy.",0
Primate-to-Human Retroviral Transmission in Asia," 

This article examines the potential for interspecies transmission of retroviruses from primates to humans in Asian ecosystems. Exploring the potentially devastating implications such a primate-to-human transmission may have on ecosystem stability and human health, this study aims to identify risk factors that could increase likelihood of viral spillover. Drawing upon data collected during field studies, as well as findings evaluated through laboratory experiments, our research looks at population density and food availability, infectious disease prevalence in wild animals, disturbances caused by human activities within natural habitats and overall environmental changes related to climate change. These topics will be discussed together with an analysis into potential preventive measures adopted both by humans living in these environments as well as government policies worldwide that are designed to help reduce risks of pathogen flows between species.",1
Autoimmune Cholangitis in the SJL/J Mouse is Antigen Non-specific,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease characterized by intrahepatic bile duct destruction and the production of anti-mitochondrial antibodies (AMA). The absence of an animal model has been a striking impedance in defining the molecular basis of disease. Previous work has suggested that SJL/J mice immunize with the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC-E2), the major mitochondrial autoantigen of PBC, leads to the development of lymphoid cell infiltration in portal tracts and a model system coined autoimmune cholangitis. We hypothesized that this pathology would be augmented if immunization occurred in the presence of IFN-γ injections. Accordingly, SJL/J mice were immunized with PDC-E2 and, for purpose of control, α-casein. Subgroups of mice were also treated with exogenous IFN-γ. As expected, mice immunized with PDC-E2, with or without IFN-γ, developed high titer AMAs. In contrast, mice immunized with α-casein, develop antinuclear antibodies. More importantly, the livers from mice immunized with PDC-E2 and/or those immunized with α-casein all displayed lymphoid cell infiltration to the portal tracts, irrespective of bile duct size. Indeed, there was no significant difference between the experimental and the control groups by histologic analysis. Thus, autoimmune cholangitis in these mice is antigen non-specific.",0
Discriminating Active from Latent Tuberculosis in Patients Presenting to Community Clinics,"

The ability to reliably differentiate active from latent tuberculosis (TB) infection has been an age-old challenge for healthcare providers. In low resource settings, community clinics lack the technical capacity to determine which patients have active TB and require treatment interventions. This study sought to discriminate active from latent TB in patients presenting at community clinics using a combination of approaches including symptoms assessment, health history review, laboratory testing and imaging techniques. Outcomes indicate that this multi-modal approach can yield reliable results with higher sensitivity than traditional methods of diagnosing TB infection alone. The findings suggest that combining multiple strategies enables more accurate discrimination between active and latent tuberculosis among patients presenting to community clinics without sophisticated resources or specialty care clinicians.",1
A novel anti-mycobacterial function of mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1,"BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the world. To combat against this pathogen, immune cells release cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), which is pivotal in the development of protective granulomas. Our previous results showed that Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG), a mycobacterium used as a model to investigate the immune response against MTB, stimulates the induction of TNF-α via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in human blood monocytes. Since MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) is known to regulate MAPK activities, we examined whether MKP-1 plays a role in BCG-induced MAPK activation and cytokine expression. RESULTS: Primary human blood monocytes were treated with BCG and assayed for MKP-1 expression. Our results demonstrated that following exposure to BCG, there was an increase in the expression of MKP-1. Additionally, the induction of MKP-1 was regulated by p38 MAPK and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2). Surprisingly, when MKP-1 expression was blocked by its specific siRNA, there was a significant decrease in the levels of phospho-MAPK (p38 MAPK and ERK1/2) and TNF-α inducible by BCG. CONCLUSIONS: Since TNF-α is pivotal in granuloma formation, the results indicated an unexpected positive function of MKP-1 against mycobacterial infection as opposed to its usual phosphatase activity.",0
"West Nile Virus Infection in Killer Whale, Texas, USA, 2007","

This paper discusses how West Nile Virus (WNV) infection spread and impacted resident Killer Whales in Texas, USA in 2007.

Innate Immune Response of Human Alveolar Macrophages during Influenza A Infection,"

The innate immune response to invasive influenza A (IAV) in human alveolar macrophages is an important component of our understanding of the host-pathogen interaction. In this paper, we explore how IAV infection specifically affects the activities and functions of alveolar macrophages. Using light and electron microscopy coupled with cell culture experiments and fluorescent probes, we analyze the cellular responses used by these cells as defense mechanisms during invasion by IAV. Our results provide insights on how some key cytokines interact with each other upon confrontation with IAV so that they can collectively combat against virus infections while avoiding inflammatory damage. Finally, using representative practical cases from different patients infected with influenza type A virus strains, we highlight a better comprehension about this type of chronic inflammation pathology and may contribute to clinical outcomes predictions for these high-risk educational immunophenotypes for future therapies purposes.",1
"Clinical features of culture-proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","OBJECTIVE: This retrospective chart review describes the epidemiology and clinical features of 40 patients with culture-proven Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections at King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Patients with positive M. pneumoniae cultures from respiratory specimens from January 1997 through December 1998 were identified through the Microbiology records. Charts of patients were reviewed. RESULTS: 40 patients were identified, 33 (82.5%) of whom required admission. Most infections (92.5%) were community-acquired. The infection affected all age groups but was most common in infants (32.5%) and pre-school children (22.5%). It occurred year-round but was most common in the fall (35%) and spring (30%). More than three-quarters of patients (77.5%) had comorbidities. Twenty-four isolates (60%) were associated with pneumonia, 14 (35%) with upper respiratory tract infections, and 2 (5%) with bronchiolitis. Cough (82.5%), fever (75%), and malaise (58.8%) were the most common symptoms, and crepitations (60%), and wheezes (40%) were the most common signs. Most patients with pneumonia had crepitations (79.2%) but only 25% had bronchial breathing. Immunocompromised patients were more likely than non-immunocompromised patients to present with pneumonia (8/9 versus 16/31, P = 0.05). Of the 24 patients with pneumonia, 14 (58.3%) had uneventful recovery, 4 (16.7%) recovered following some complications, 3 (12.5%) died because of M pneumoniae infection, and 3 (12.5%) died due to underlying comorbidities. The 3 patients who died of M pneumoniae pneumonia had other comorbidities. CONCLUSION: our results were similar to published data except for the finding that infections were more common in infants and preschool children and that the mortality rate of pneumonia in patients with comorbidities was high.",0
Analysis of Memory B Cell Responses and Isolation of Novel Monoclonal Antibodies with Neutralizing Breadth from HIV-1-Infected Individuals,"BACKGROUND: The isolation of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize a broad spectrum of primary HIV-1 isolates and the characterization of the human neutralizing antibody B cell response to HIV-1 infection are important goals that are central to the design of an effective antibody-based vaccine. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We immortalized IgG(+) memory B cells from individuals infected with diverse clades of HIV-1 and selected on the basis of plasma neutralization profiles that were cross-clade and relatively potent. Culture supernatants were screened using various recombinant forms of the envelope glycoproteins (Env) in multiple parallel assays. We isolated 58 mAbs that were mapped to different Env surfaces, most of which showed neutralizing activity. One mAb in particular (HJ16) specific for a novel epitope proximal to the CD4 binding site on gp120 selectively neutralized a multi-clade panel of Tier-2 HIV-1 pseudoviruses, and demonstrated reactivity that was comparable in breadth, but distinct in neutralization specificity, to that of the other CD4 binding site-specific neutralizing mAb b12. A second mAb (HGN194) bound a conserved epitope in the V3 crown and neutralized all Tier-1 and a proportion of Tier-2 pseudoviruses tested, irrespective of clade. A third mAb (HK20) with broad neutralizing activity, particularly as a Fab fragment, recognized a highly conserved epitope in the HR-1 region of gp41, but showed striking assay-dependent selectivity in its activity. CONCLUSIONS: This study reveals that by using appropriate screening methods, a large proportion of memory B cells can be isolated that produce mAbs with HIV-1 neutralizing activity. Three of these mAbs show unusual breadth of neutralization and therefore add to the current panel of HIV-1 neutralizing antibodies with potential for passive protection and template-based vaccine design.",0
Porcine Noroviruses Related to Human Noroviruses,"

The journal titled 'Porcine Noroviruses Related to Human Noroviruses' presents a comprehensive overview of the cause, transmission and development of porcine norovirus (PNV) infections. It elucidates their epidemiology, reviews laboratory methods used to diagnose PNV in different animal species, and evaluates their potential public health implications. This article discusses several critical aspects of PNV infection that are pertinent to both animal and human health including host susceptibility, clinical pathogenesis and the role played by environmental factors in propagation. Furthermore, with respect to control measures for reducing or eliminating this viral group’s potential adverse implications on human health, some effective countermeasures such as surveillance networks are highlighted along with other related preventive strategies that can be applied both top-down at the global level or locally through individualised management plans.  Therefore, this paper provides an up-to-date review which will have both economic importance as well as improve our understanding concerning the dynamics associated with these emerging zoonotic viruses.",1
A Quantitative Method for the Specific Assessment of Caspase-6 Activity in Cell Culture,"

This study presents a quantitative method for the assessment of caspase-6 activity in cell culture, offering an accurate and reliable approach for investigating their cellular functions. A plant-derived proenzyme positively identified as Caspase-6 (CASP6) was examined to characterize its physiological roles in apoptosis. Furthermore, this study determined whether targeted inhibition of CASP6 would result in increased or decreased levels of cell death compared to untreated cells. A stabilized Caspase-substrate peptide cleavage assay was employed to quantitate enzyme activity at different time points following stimulation with a classical apoptotic inducer - staurosporine. Results demonstrated that treated samples had significantly higher concentration levels than untreated controls but differences between conditions remained within expected range values throughout the experiment period. This methodology offers insight into how changes in caspase activity may affect cell viability, providing key information on their function during programmed cell death programmes.",1
"The impact of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 compared with seasonal influenza on intensive care admissions in New South Wales, Australia, 2007 to 2010: a time series analysis","

This study assesses the time series analysis of intensive care admissions attributed to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 compared with seasonal influenza in New South Wales (NSW), Australia, over a four-year period from 2007 to 2010. We investigate the highest incidence of cases and associated morbidity levels among individuals requiring admission to ICUs, focusing particularly on age groups most at risk and variations between communities across NSW. Considering the increasing public health need for effective disease monitoring, this report aims to analyze whether or not there has been an increased severity or mortality rate due to H1N1 when compared with standard seasonal flu infections.

The Impact of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Compared with Seasonal Influenza on Intensive Care Admissions in New South Wales, Australia: A Time Series Analysis. This longitudinal study focuses on determining how significantly different intensities and morbidities were noted during overlapping seasons where both influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and sporadic strains of classically circulating seasonal flu viruses were present as well as identifying populations which may be at greater risk for illness related hospitalization or mortality post infection. The data analyzed was obtained through publicly available electronic medical records sourced from select hospitals in NSW over the four year period (2007 – 2010). By analyzing trends within this limited dataset researchers can explore significant differences between those infected by HINI pandemic strain versus annual virus strains while also exploring protective factors that might have moderated outcomes since some individuals reported comorbid conditions known to worsen infection risks when exposed to either overall type pathogens. Additionally important are considerations such as rare severe infections possibly linked directly with yearly variants versus peak periods tied more closely genetic makeup than otherwise observed patterns more typical in endemic situations seen throughout many areas primarily influenced/impacted by lack of proper preventative vaccinations",1
"In China, Students in Crowded Dormitories with a Low Ventilation Rate Have More Common Colds: Evidence for Airborne Transmission","

This article presents an analysis of the effect that overcrowding and low ventilation rates have on the incidence of common colds among students living in dormitories in China. The study used data collected over a six-month period from two university campuses to compare levels of viral respiratory transmission based on residence hall size and average air exchange rate per hour per person. The results demonstrate higher levels of infection within larger buildings with lower ventilation, suggestive evidence for airborne transmission as a likely source. Furthermore, it was also observed that overcrowding reduced antiviral immunity among those affected which allowed spread through direct contact more easily than if individuals had access to improved ventilation or relaxation in numbers. As these findings suggest potential mechanisms through which uncontrolled virus biological transmission can occur, they provide support for targeted interventions towards promoting better airflow capacity and reducing crowding in shared living spaces.",1
Non-Invasive Microstructure and Morphology Investigation of the Mouse Lung: Qualitative Description and Quantitative Measurement,"BACKGROUND: Early detection of lung cancer is known to improve the chances of successful treatment. However, lungs are soft tissues with complex three-dimensional configuration. Conventional X-ray imaging is based purely on absorption resulting in very low contrast when imaging soft tissues without contrast agents. It is difficult to obtain adequate information of lung lesions from conventional X-ray imaging. METHODS: In this study, a recently emerged imaging technique, in-line X-ray phase contrast imaging (IL-XPCI) was used. This powerful technique enabled high-resolution investigations of soft tissues without contrast agents. We applied IL-XPCI to observe the lungs in an intact mouse for the purpose of defining quantitatively the micro-structures in lung. FINDINGS: The three-dimensional model of the lung was successfully established, which provided an excellent view of lung airways. We highlighted the use of IL-XPCI in the visualization and assessment of alveoli which had rarely been studied in three dimensions (3D). The precise view of individual alveolus was achieved. The morphological parameters, such as diameter and alveolar surface area were measured. These parameters were of great importance in the diagnosis of diseases related to alveolus and alveolar scar. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that IL-XPCI had the ability to represent complex anatomical structures in lung. This offered a new perspective on the diagnosis of respiratory disease and may guide future work in the study of respiratory mechanism on the alveoli level.",0
Calciomics: prediction and analysis of EF-hand calcium binding proteins by protein engineering,"Ca(2+) plays a pivotal role in the physiology and biochemistry of prokaryotic and mammalian organisms. Viruses also utilize the universal Ca(2+) signal to create a specific cellular environment to achieve coexistence with the host, and to propagate. In this paper we first describe our development of a grafting approach to understand site-specific Ca(2+) binding properties of EF-hand proteins with a helix-loop-helix Ca(2+) binding motif, then summarize our prediction and identification of EF-hand Ca(2+) binding sites on a genome-wide scale in bacteria and virus, and next report the application of the grafting approach to probe the metal binding capability of predicted EF-hand motifs within the streptococcal hemoprotein receptor (Shr) of Streptococcus pyrogenes and the nonstructural protein 1 (nsP1) of Sindbis virus. When methods such as the grafting approach are developed in conjunction with prediction algorithms we are better able to probe continuous Ca(2+)-binding sites that have been previously underrepresented due to the limitation of conventional methodology.",0
Intrapulmonary administration of recombinant activated factor VII in diffuse alveolar haemorrhage: a report of two case stories,"BACKGROUND: Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage (DAH) is a serious pulmonary complication characterised by a high mortality rate and the absence of specific treatment. The intrapulmonary administration of activated recombinant factor VII (rFVIIa) in DAH was recently published in six patients by Heslet et al with an efficient hemostatic effect. We describe two cases of DAH treated with intrapulmonary rFVIIa. METHODS: Two cases of DAH were admitted to the ICU after presenting abrupt desaturation, tachypnea, cough and haemoptysis, requiring orotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. The diagnosis was achieved by the bloody return during the bronchoalveolar lavage, during the procedure rFVIIa (50 μg/Kg in 50 ml of isotonic saline) was administered via the bronchoscope. RESULTS: Immediate cessation of bleeding was observed. Prior to intrapulmonary administration of rFVIIa, the FiO(2 )was 1, which was reduced to 0.4 24 hours later. Following the procedure, the haemostatic effect made blood transfusion superfluous. No thrombotic complications associated with administration of the drug were observed. After the intervention both cases progressed fast and was discharged from the ICU with no further episodes of bleeding. CONCLUSION: 1. Local intrabronchial deposition of DAH with rFVIIa has been shown to be effective in controlling life-threatening DAH. 2. In the case described above, no thrombotic complications were observed following the intrapulmonary administration of rFVIIa.",0
Role of receptor polymorphism and glycosylation in syncytium induction and host range variation of ecotropic mouse gammaretroviruses,"BACKGROUND: We previously identified unusual variants of Moloney and Friend ecotropic mouse gammaretroviruses that have altered host range and are cytopathic in cells of the wild mouse species Mus dunni. Cytopathicity was attributed to different amino acid substitutions at the same critical env residue involved in receptor interaction: S82F in the Moloney variant Spl574, and S84A in the Friend mouse leukemia virus F-S MLV. Because M. dunni cells carry a variant CAT-1 cell surface virus receptor (dCAT-1), we examined the role of this receptor variant in cytopathicity and host range. RESULTS: We expressed dCAT-1 or mCAT-1 of NIH 3T3 origin in cells that are not normally infectible with ecotropic MLVs and evaluated the transfectants for susceptibility to virus infection and to virus-induced syncytium formation. The dCAT-1 transfectants, but not the mCAT-1 transfectants, were susceptible to virus-induced cytopathicity, and this cytopathic response was accompanied by the accumulation of unintegrated viral DNA. The dCAT-1 transfectants, however, did not also reproduce the relative resistance of M. dunni cells to Moloney MLV, and the mCAT-1 transfectants did not show the relative resistance of NIH 3T3 cells to Spl574. Western analysis, use of glycosylation inhibitors and mutagenesis to remove receptor glycosylation sites identified a possible role for cell-specific glycosylation in the modulation of virus entry. CONCLUSION: Virus entry and virus-induced syncytium formation using the CAT-1 receptor are mediated by a small number of critical amino acid residues in receptor and virus Env. Virus entry is modulated by glycosylation of cellular proteins, and this effect is cell and virus-specific.",0
Model of end stage liver disease (MELD) score greater than 23 predicts length of stay in the ICU but not mortality in liver transplant recipients,"INTRODUCTION: The impact of model of end stage liver disease (MELD) score on postoperative morbidity and mortality is still elusive, especially for high MELD. There are reports of poorer patient outcome in transplant candidates with high MELD score, others though report no influence of MELD score on outcome and survival. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data of 144 consecutive liver transplant recipients over a 72-month period in our transplant unit, from January 2003 until December 2008 and performed uni- and multivariate analysis for morbidity and mortality, in particular to define the influence of MELD to these parameters. RESULTS: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by intensive care unit (ICU) stay longer than 10 days (odds ratio 7.0) but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. Furthermore, we identified transfusion of more than 7 units of red blood cells as independent risk factor for mortality (hazard ratio 7.6) and for prolonged ICU stay (odds ratio [OR] 7.8) together with transfusion of more than 10 units of fresh frozen plasma (OR 11.6). Postoperative renal failure is a strong predictor of morbidity (OR 7.9) and postoperative renal replacement therapy was highly associated with increased mortality (hazard ratio 6.8), as was hepato renal syndrome prior to transplantation (hazard ratio 13.2). CONCLUSIONS: This study identified MELD score greater than 23 as an independent risk factor of morbidity represented by ICU stay longer than 10 days but in contrast had no negative impact on mortality. This finding supports the transplantation of patients with high MELD score but only with knowledge of increased morbidity.",0
Diagnostic value of triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1 and C-reactive protein for patients with lung infiltrates: an observational study,"BACKGROUND: Differential diagnosis of patients with lung infiltrates remains a challenge. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells (TREM)-1 is a neutrophil and monocyte receptor up-regulated during infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of TREM-1 and of C-reactive protein (CRP) from patients with lung infiltrates to discern community acquired lung infections. METHODS: 68 patients admitted to a medical ward with acute respiratory illness were enrolled in the study. Neutrophil and monocyte TREM-1 expression were measured by flow cytometry, sTREM-1 by an enzyme immunoassay and C-reactive protein by nephelometry. Clinical pulmonary infection score was recorded. RESULTS: 34 patients were diagnosed with bacterial community acquired pneumonia (group A) and 34 with non-bacterial pulmonary disease (group B). Median serum TREM-1 concentration was 102.09 pg/ml in group A and lower than 15.10 pg/ml (p < 0.0001) in group B. Mean±SE neutrophil TREM-1 expression was 4.67 ± 0.53 MFI in group A and 2.64 ± 0.25 MFI (p = 0.001) in group B. Monocyte TREM-1 expression was 4.2 ± 0.42 MFI in group A and 2.64 ± 0.35 MFI (p = 0.007) in group B and mean±SE CRP was 18.03 ± 2 mg/ml in group A and 7.1 ± 1.54 mg/ml (p < 0.001) in group B. A cut-off of 19.53 pg/ml of sTREM-1 with sensitivity 82.6% and specificity 63% to discriminate between infectious and non-infectious pulmonary infiltrates was found. sTREM-1 at admission greater than 180 pg/ml was accompanied with unfavourable outcome. CONCLUSION: TREM-1 myeloid expression and sTREM-1 are reliable markers of bacterial infection among patients with pulmonary infiltrates; sTREM-1 is a predictor of final outcome.",0
Neighborhood Properties Are Important Determinants of Temperature Sensitive Mutations,"

This article presents a comprehensive exploration of neighborhood properties as important determinants of temperature sensitive mutations. Through an integrative analysis, we demonstrate that the physical environment, local habitats and social structures completely or partly determine population-scale evolutionary dynamics by creating intricate effects on genetic variation. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that proximal characteristics of a region can affect natural selection and guide mutational paths both in small and large scale populations alike. To assess them accurately, we apply advanced genetics analytics to obtain insights into community-level effects associated with thermally driven fluctuations at various levels throughout time spans ranging from short durations to long periods. The evaluation also reveals apparent correlations between regional temperatures and various components directly affiliated with molecular modifications affecting organismal physiology at different spatial scales across resulting cohorts of conspecifics occupying diverse environmental niches. Based on our findings, it is suggested that neighborhoods have considerable influence upon mutation patterns which highlights their importance when interpreting evolution over multiple generations in response to dynamic conditions such as those present due to abiotic factors like temperature change.",1
Effect of Asymptomatic Natural Infections due to Common Mouse Pathogens on the Metastatic Progression of B16 Murine Melanoma in C57BL/6 Mice,"

This paper presents a study summarizing the effect of asymptomatic natural infections due to common mouse pathogens on the metastatic progression of B16 murine melanoma in C57BL/6 mice. We used an experimental animal model and monitored for several weeks post-inoculation with indicated pathogens. Pathogenic microorganisms have been suggested to influence neoplastic progression, but their role remains enigmatic and largely unexplored. Thus, this work attempts to expand upon current measures by investigating whether common mouse pathogenic agents may covertly alter disease proliferation through non-symptomatic infections. Results showed that mice naturally infected with bacterial or viral agents had statistically significant increases in lymph node size when compared to control groups without infection after inoculation with B16 melanoma cells. These findings suggest that asymptomatic natural infections due to common mouse pathogens facilitate tumorigenesis and metastatic growth in spite of lacking any canonical symptoms themselves, hinting at a possible synergistic relationship between infectious diseases and cancer development which warrants further investigation.",1
Designing and conducting tabletop exercises to assess public health preparedness for manmade and naturally occurring biological threats,"BACKGROUND: Since 2001, state and local health departments in the United States (US) have accelerated efforts to prepare for high-impact public health emergencies. One component of these activities has been the development and conduct of exercise programs to assess capabilities, train staff and build relationships. This paper summarizes lessons learned from tabletop exercises about public health emergency preparedness and about the process of developing, conducting, and evaluating them. METHODS: We developed, conducted, and evaluated 31 tabletop exercises in partnership with state and local health departments throughout the US from 2003 to 2006. Participant self evaluations, after action reports, and tabletop exercise evaluation forms were used to identify aspects of the exercises themselves, as well as public health emergency responses that participants found more or less challenging, and to highlight lessons learned about tabletop exercise design. RESULTS: Designing the exercises involved substantial collaboration with representatives from participating health departments to assure that the scenarios were credible, focused attention on local preparedness needs and priorities, and were logistically feasible to implement. During execution of the exercises, nearly all health departments struggled with a common set of challenges relating to disease surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, communications, command and control, and health care surge capacity. In contrast, performance strengths were more varied across participating sites, reflecting specific attributes of individual health departments or communities, experience with actual public health emergencies, or the emphasis of prior preparedness efforts. CONCLUSION: The design, conduct, and evaluation of the tabletop exercises described in this report benefited from collaborative planning that involved stakeholders from participating health departments and exercise developers and facilitators from outside the participating agencies. While these exercises identified both strengths and vulnerabilities in emergency preparedness, additional work is needed to develop reliable metrics to gauge exercise performance, inform follow-up action steps, and to develop re-evaluation exercise designs that assess the impact of post-exercise interventions.",0

This research paper presents a new nondisposable microplate that has been developed for use with organic solvents. The microplate offers an advantageous, cost-effective alternative to conventional disposable plates and is made of polytetrafluoroethylene which ensures excellent resistance to organic solvents. Advantages include minimal reagent consumption, surface morphology consistency and high cell viability of up to ninety-nine percent when cultured on the plate's synthetic surface. Additionally, this study demonstrates how its thorough evaluation guarantees outstanding performance under optimal environmental conditions such as those encountered in the life sciences industry. Finally, the potential applications and future directions are identified involving biosensors, enzyme assays and other laboratory experiments relevant to both academic and commercial purposes.",1
Nasal Delivery of an Adenovirus-Based Vaccine Bypasses Pre-Existing Immunity to the Vaccine Carrier and Improves the Immune Response in Mice,"Pre-existing immunity to human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) is common in the general population. Bypassing pre-existing immunity could maximize Ad5 vaccine efficacy. Vaccination by the intramuscular (I.M.), nasal (I.N.) or oral (P.O.) route with Ad5 expressing Ebola Zaire glycoprotein (Ad5-ZGP) fully protected naïve mice against lethal challenge with Ebola. In the presence of pre-existing immunity, only mice vaccinated I.N. survived. The frequency of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells was reduced by 80% and by 15% in animals vaccinated by the I.M. and P.O. routes respectively. Neutralizing antibodies could not be detected in serum from either treatment group. Pre-existing immunity did not compromise the frequency of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells (3.9±1% naïve vs. 3.6±1% pre-existing immunity, PEI) nor anti-Ebola neutralizing antibody (NAB, 40±10 reciprocal dilution, both groups). The number of INF-γ+ CD8+ cells detected in bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) after I.N. immunization was not compromised by pre-existing immunity to Ad5 (146±14, naïve vs. 120±16 SFC/million MNCs, PEI). However, pre-existing immunity reduced NAB levels in BAL by ∼25% in this group. To improve the immune response after oral vaccination, the Ad5-based vaccine was PEGylated. Mice given the modified vaccine did not survive challenge and had reduced levels of IFN-γ+ CD8+ T cells 10 days after administration (0.3±0.3% PEG vs. 1.7±0.5% unmodified). PEGylation did increase NAB levels 2-fold. These results provide some insight about the degree of T and B cell mediated immunity necessary for protection against Ebola virus and suggest that modification of the virus capsid can influence the type of immune response elicited by an Ad5-based vaccine.",0
Emerging Technologies for the Detection of Rabies Virus: Challenges and Hopes in the 21st Century,"The diagnosis of rabies is routinely based on clinical and epidemiological information, especially when exposures are reported in rabies-endemic countries. Diagnostic tests using conventional assays that appear to be negative, even when undertaken late in the disease and despite the clinical diagnosis, have a tendency, at times, to be unreliable. These tests are rarely optimal and entirely dependent on the nature and quality of the sample supplied. In the course of the past three decades, the application of molecular biology has aided in the development of tests that result in a more rapid detection of rabies virus. These tests enable viral strain identification from clinical specimens. Currently, there are a number of molecular tests that can be used to complement conventional tests in rabies diagnosis. Indeed the challenges in the 21st century for the development of rabies diagnostics are not of a technical nature; these tests are available now. The challenges in the 21st century for diagnostic test developers are two-fold: firstly, to achieve internationally accepted validation of a test that will then lead to its acceptance by organisations globally. Secondly, the areas of the world where such tests are needed are mainly in developing regions where financial and logistical barriers prevent their implementation. Although developing countries with a poor healthcare infrastructure recognise that molecular-based diagnostic assays will be unaffordable for routine use, the cost/benefit ratio should still be measured. Adoption of rapid and affordable rabies diagnostic tests for use in developing countries highlights the importance of sharing and transferring technology through laboratory twinning between the developed and the developing countries. Importantly for developing countries, the benefit of molecular methods as tools is the capability for a differential diagnosis of human diseases that present with similar clinical symptoms. Antemortem testing for human rabies is now possible using molecular techniques. These barriers are not insurmountable and it is our expectation that if such tests are accepted and implemented where they are most needed, they will provide substantial improvements for rabies diagnosis and surveillance. The advent of molecular biology and new technological initiatives that combine advances in biology with other disciplines will support the development of techniques capable of high throughput testing with a low turnaround time for rabies diagnosis.",0
"Integrating Genome-based Informatics to Modernize Global Disease Monitoring, Information Sharing, and Response","

This study examines how advancements in genome-based informatics can be integrated to modernize global disease monitoring, facilitate better information sharing, and aid efficient responses. While advances in genomic sequencing technology have enabled researchers to gain a better understanding of the underlying biology of diseases, there still remain considerable gaps in the global network of health care systems and medical infrastructure required for effective surveillance and response. This research seeks to understand the potential applications of scaling existing informatics solutions around genomics data resources so that greater visibility into outbreak trends can be attained within national parameters across multiple nations as well as transnationally. In addition, it will investigate how rapid access to relevant epidemiological datasets could enable more timely public health interventions as well as strengthen immunity levels against outbreaks spurred by non-communicable diseases such as hereditary cancer syndromes or multigene disorders. By highlighting long-term benefits of integrating advances from several disciplines related to computational biomedicine, this paper aims at advancing our understanding for large scale application aiming towards universalized population level prevention strategies tailored to local settings.",1
A novel endonuclease IV post-PCR genotyping system,"Here we describe a novel endonuclease IV (Endo IV) based assay utilizing a substrate that mimics the abasic lesions that normally occur in double-stranded DNA. The three component substrate is characterized by single-stranded DNA target, an oligonucleotide probe, separated from a helper oligonucleotide by a one base gap. The oligonucleotide probe contains a non-fluorescent quencher at the 5′ end and fluorophore attached to the 3′ end through a special rigid linker. Fluorescence of the oligonucleotide probe is efficiently quenched by the interaction of terminal dye and quencher when not hybridized. Upon hybridization of the oligonucleotide probe and helper probe to their complementary target, the phosphodiester linkage between the rigid linker and the 3′ end of the probe is efficiently cleaved, generating a fluorescent signal. In this study, the use of the Endo IV assay as a post-PCR amplification detection system is demonstrated. High sensitivity and specificity are illustrated using single nucleotide polymorphism detection.",0
Accurate noise projection for reduced stochastic epidemic models,"We consider a stochastic susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (SEIR) epidemiological model. Through the use of a normal form coordinate transform, we are able to analytically derive the stochastic center manifold along with the associated, reduced set of stochastic evolution equations. The transformation correctly projects both the dynamics and the noise onto the center manifold. Therefore, the solution of this reduced stochastic dynamical system yields excellent agreement, both in amplitude and phase, with the solution of the original stochastic system for a temporal scale that is orders of magnitude longer than the typical relaxation time. This new method allows for improved time series prediction of the number of infectious cases when modeling the spread of disease in a population. Numerical solutions of the fluctuations of the SEIR model are considered in the infinite population limit using a Langevin equation approach, as well as in a finite population simulated as a Markov process.",0
"The cucumovirus 2b gene drives selection of inter-viral recombinants affecting the crossover site, the acceptor RNA and the rate of selection","RNA–RNA recombination is an important pathway in virus evolution and has been described for many viruses. However, the factors driving recombination or promoting the selection of recombinants are still unclear. Here, we show that the small movement protein (2b) was able to promote selection of RNA 1/2–RNA 3 recombinants within a chimeric virus having RNAs 1 and 2 from cucumber mosaic virus, and RNA 3 from the related tomato aspermy virus, along with heterologous 2b genes. The source of the 2b also determined the selection of the acceptor RNA and the crossover site, as well as affecting the rate of selection of the recombinant RNAs. The nature of the RNA 3 also influenced the selection of the recombinant RNAs. A 163-nt tandem repeat in RNA 3 significantly affected the rate of selection of the recombinant RNA, while a single nucleotide within the repeat affected the crossover site. The recombination occurred in a non-random manner, involved no intermediates and probably was generated via a copy-choice mechanism during (+) strand RNA synthesis.",0
Breaking the Waves: Modelling the Potential Impact of Public Health Measures to Defer the Epidemic Peak of Novel Influenza A/H1N1,"BACKGROUND: On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared phase 6 of the novel influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. Although by the end of September 2009, the novel virus had been reported from all continents, the impact in most countries of the northern hemisphere has been limited. The return of the virus in a second wave would encounter populations that are still nonimmune and not vaccinated yet. We modelled the effect of control strategies to reduce the spread with the goal to defer the epidemic wave in a country where it is detected in a very early stage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We constructed a deterministic SEIR model using the age distribution and size of the population of Germany based on the observed number of imported cases and the early findings for the epidemiologic characteristics described by Fraser (Science, 2009). We propose a two-step control strategy with an initial effort to trace, quarantine, and selectively give prophylactic treatment to contacts of the first 100 to 500 cases. In the second step, the same measures are focused on the households of the next 5,000 to 10,000 cases. As a result, the peak of the epidemic could be delayed up to 7.6 weeks if up to 30% of cases are detected. However, the cumulative attack rates would not change. Necessary doses of antivirals would be less than the number of treatment courses for 0.1% of the population. In a sensitivity analysis, both case detection rate and the variation of R0 have major effects on the resulting delay. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Control strategies that reduce the spread of the disease during the early phase of a pandemic wave may lead to a substantial delay of the epidemic. Since prophylactic treatment is only offered to the contacts of the first 10,000 cases, the amount of antivirals needed is still very limited.",0
Efficacy of Oseltamivir-Zanamivir Combination Compared to Each Monotherapy for Seasonal Influenza: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial,"BACKGROUND: Neuraminidase inhibitors are thought to be efficacious in reducing the time to alleviation of symptoms in outpatients with seasonal influenza. The objective of this study was to compare the short-term virological efficacy of oseltamivir-zanamivir combination versus each monotherapy plus placebo. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a randomized placebo-controlled trial with 145 general practitioners throughout France during the 2008–2009 seasonal influenza epidemic. Patients, general practitioners, and outcome assessors were all blinded to treatment assignment. Adult outpatients presenting influenza-like illness for less than 36 hours and a positive influenza A rapid test diagnosis were randomized to oseltamivir 75 mg orally twice daily plus zanamivir 10 mg by inhalation twice daily (OZ), oseltamivir plus inhaled placebo (O), or zanamivir plus oral placebo (Z). Treatment efficacy was assessed virologically according to the proportion of patients with nasal influenza reverse transcription (RT)-PCR below 200 copies genome equivalent (cgeq)/µl at day 2 (primary outcome), and clinically to the time to alleviation of symptoms until day 14. Overall 541 patients (of the 900 planned) were included (OZ, n = 192; O, n = 176; Z, n = 173), 49% male, mean age 39 years. In the intention-to-treat analysis conducted in the 447 patients with RT-PCR-confirmed influenza A, 46%, 59%, and 34% in OZ (n = 157), O (n = 141), and Z (n = 149) arms had RT-PCR<200 cgeq/µl (−13.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] −23.1 to −2.9, p = 0.025; +12.3%, 95% CI 2.39–22.2, p = 0.028 for OZ/O and OZ/Z comparisons). Mean day 0 to day 2 viral load decrease was 2.14, 2.49, and 1.68 log(10) cgeq/µl (p = 0.060, p = 0.016 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Median time to alleviation of symptoms was 4.0, 3.0, and 4.0 days (+1.0, 95% CI 0.0–4.0, p = 0.018; +0.0, 95% CI −3.0 to 3.0, p = 0.960 for OZ/O and OZ/Z). Four severe adverse events were observed. Nausea and/or vomiting tended to be more frequent in the combination arm (OZ, n = 13; O, n = 4; and Z, n = 5 patients, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: In adults with seasonal influenza A mainly H3N2 virus infection, the oseltamivir-zanamivir combination appeared less effective than oseltamivir monotherapy, and not significantly more effective than zanamivir monotherapy. Despite the theoretical potential for the reduction of the emergence of antiviral resistance, the lower effectiveness of this combination calls for caution in its use in clinical practice.

Evidence that Gag facilitates HIV-1 envelope association both in GPI-enriched plasma membrane and detergent resistant membranes and facilitates envelope incorporation onto virions in primary CD4(+ )T cells,"HIV-1 particle assembly mediated by viral Gag protein occurs predominantly at plasma membrane. While colocalization of HIV-1 envelope with lipid rich microenvironment have been shown in T cells, the significance of viral proteins modulating envelope association in such microdomains in plasma membrane enriched in glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins in primary CD4(+ )T cells that are natural targets of HIV-1 is poorly understood. Here we show that in primary CD4(+ )T cells that are natural targets of HIV-1 in vivo, Gag modulates HIV-1 envelope association with GM1 ganglioside and CD59 rich cellular compartments as well as with detergent resistant membranes. Our data strengthen evidence that Gag-Env interaction is important in envelope association with lipid rafts containing GPI-anchored proteins for efficient assembly onto mature virions resulting in productive infection of primary CD4(+ )T cells.",0
"DetectiV: visualization, normalization and significance testing for pathogen-detection microarray data","DNA microarrays offer the possibility of testing for the presence of thousands of micro-organisms in a single experiment. However, there is a lack of reliable bioinformatics tools for the analysis of such data. We have developed DetectiV, a package for the statistical software R. DetectiV offers powerful yet simple visualization, normalization and significance testing tools. We show that DetectiV performs better than previously published software on a large, publicly available dataset.",0
Alternative splicing of CD200 is regulated by an exonic splicing enhancer and SF2/ASF,"CD200, a type I membrane glycoprotein, plays an important role in prevention of inflammatory disorders, graft rejection, autoimmune diseases and spontaneous fetal loss. It also regulates tumor immunity. A truncated CD200 (CD200(tr)) resulting from alternative splicing has been identified and characterized as a functional antagonist to full-length CD200. Thus, it is important to explore the mechanism(s) controlling alternative splicing of CD200. In this study, we identified an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) located in exon 2, which is a putative binding site for a splicing regulatory protein SF2/ASF. Deletion or mutation of the ESE site decreased expression of the full-length CD200. Direct binding of SF2/ASF to the ESE site was confirmed by RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Knockdown of expression of SF2/ASF resulted in the same splicing pattern as seen after deletion or mutation of the ESE, whereas overexpression of SF2/ASF increased expression of the full-length CD200. In vivo studies showed that viral infection reversed the alternative splicing pattern of CD200 with increased expression of SF2/ASF and the full-length CD200. Taken together, our data suggest for the first time that SF2/ASF regulates the function of CD200 by controlling CD200 alternative splicing, through direct binding to an ESE located in exon 2 of CD200.",0
True versus False Parasite Interactions: A Robust Method to Take Risk Factors into Account and Its Application to Feline Viruses,"

True versus False Parasite Interactions: A Robust Method to Take Risk Factors into Account and Its Application to Feline Viruses provides an approach for identifying and quantifying the risks of parasite interactions posed by infectious diseases in cats. After decades of research, few effective strategies exist for managing parasitic populations within a pet’s environment. To successfully curb the problem, scientists must take risk factors associated with such interactions into account when designing epidemiological studies. Therefore, our study aimed at developing a procedure for determining these parameters in order to assess parasites' ability to modify feline viruses transmission dynamics. The outcomes demonstrate how this approach effectively integrates data from multiple sources and can be used for controlling zoonotic pathogens in cats that pose public health concerns as well as animal welfare issues. Our findings suggest it is possible to accurately predict disease prevalence patterns given specific risk profiles making our method applicable on both inter-species levels and locally - facilitating better intervention measures like prophylactic treatments or population management programs in affected regions – which will ultimately lead towards a more sustainable outcome of communicable pathogen control efforts especially among pets living indoors or outdoors alike.",1
The intrinsically disordered C‐terminal domain of the measles virus nucleoprotein interacts with the C‐terminal domain of the phosphoprotein via two distinct sites and remains predominantly unfolded,"Measles virus is a negative‐sense, single‐stranded RNA virus within theMononegavirales order,which includes several human pathogens, including rabies, Ebola, Nipah, and Hendra viruses. Themeasles virus nucleoprotein consists of a structured N‐terminal domain, and of an intrinsically disordered C‐terminal domain, N(TAIL) (aa 401–525), which undergoes induced folding in the presence of the C‐terminal domain (XD, aa 459–507) of the viral phosphoprotein. With in N(TAIL), an α‐helical molecular recognition element (α‐MoRE, aa 488–499) involved in binding to P and in induced folding was identified and then observed in the crystal structure of XD. Using small‐angle X‐ray scattering, we have derived a low‐resolution structural model of the complex between XD and N(TAIL), which shows that most of N(TAIL) remains disordered in the complex despite P‐induced folding within the α‐MoRE. The model consists of an extended shape accommodating the multiple conformations adopted by the disordered N‐terminal region of N(TAIL), and of a bulky globular region, corresponding to XD and to the C terminus of N(TAIL) (aa 486–525). Using surface plasmon resonance, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, and heteronuclear magnetic resonance, we show that N(TAIL) has an additional site (aa 517–525) involved in binding to XD but not in the unstructured‐to‐structured transition. This work provides evidence that intrinsically disordered domains can establish complex interactions with their partners, and can contact them through multiple sites that do not all necessarily gain regular secondary structure.",0
A Porcine Adenovirus with Low Human Seroprevalence Is a Promising Alternative Vaccine Vector to Human Adenovirus 5 in an H5N1 Virus Disease Model,"Human adenovirus 5 (AdHu5) vectors are robust vaccine platforms however the presence of naturally-acquired neutralizing antibodies may reduce vector efficacy and potential for re-administration. This study evaluates immune responses and protection following vaccination with a replication-incompetent porcine adenovirus 3 (PAV3) vector as an alternative vaccine to AdHu5 using an avian influenza H5N1 disease model. Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in BALB/c mice following vaccination with different doses of the PAV3 vector expressing an optimized A/Hanoi/30408/2005 H5N1 hemagglutinin antigen (PAV3-HA) and compared with an AdHu5-HA control. PAV3-HA rapidly generated antibody responses, with significant neutralizing antibody titers on day 21, and stronger cellular immune responses detected on day 8, compared to AdHu5-HA. The PAV3-HA vaccine, administered 8 days before challenge, demonstrated improved survival and lower virus load. Evaluation of long-term vaccine efficacy at 12 months post-vaccination showed better protection with the PAV3-HA than with the AdHu5-HA vaccine. Importantly, as opposed to AdHu5, PAV3 vector was not significantly neutralized by human antibodies pooled from over 10,000 individuals. Overall, PAV3-based vector is capable of mediating swift, strong immune responses and offer a promising alternative to AdHu5.",0
Patterns of Positive Selection in Six Mammalian Genomes,"Genome-wide scans for positively selected genes (PSGs) in mammals have provided insight into the dynamics of genome evolution, the genetic basis of differences between species, and the functions of individual genes. However, previous scans have been limited in power and accuracy owing to small numbers of available genomes. Here we present the most comprehensive examination of mammalian PSGs to date, using the six high-coverage genome assemblies now available for eutherian mammals. The increased phylogenetic depth of this dataset results in substantially improved statistical power, and permits several new lineage- and clade-specific tests to be applied. Of ∼16,500 human genes with high-confidence orthologs in at least two other species, 400 genes showed significant evidence of positive selection (FDR<0.05), according to a standard likelihood ratio test. An additional 144 genes showed evidence of positive selection on particular lineages or clades. As in previous studies, the identified PSGs were enriched for roles in defense/immunity, chemosensory perception, and reproduction, but enrichments were also evident for more specific functions, such as complement-mediated immunity and taste perception. Several pathways were strongly enriched for PSGs, suggesting possible co-evolution of interacting genes. A novel Bayesian analysis of the possible “selection histories” of each gene indicated that most PSGs have switched multiple times between positive selection and nonselection, suggesting that positive selection is often episodic. A detailed analysis of Affymetrix exon array data indicated that PSGs are expressed at significantly lower levels, and in a more tissue-specific manner, than non-PSGs. Genes that are specifically expressed in the spleen, testes, liver, and breast are significantly enriched for PSGs, but no evidence was found for an enrichment for PSGs among brain-specific genes. This study provides additional evidence for widespread positive selection in mammalian evolution and new genome-wide insights into the functional implications of positive selection.",0
Towards standardization of RNA quality assessment using user-independent classifiers of microcapillary electrophoresis traces,"While it is universally accepted that intact RNA constitutes the best representation of the steady-state of transcription, there is no gold standard to define RNA quality prior to gene expression analysis. In this report, we evaluated the reliability of conventional methods for RNA quality assessment including UV spectroscopy and 28S:18S area ratios, and demonstrated their inconsistency. We then used two new freely available classifiers, the Degradometer and RIN systems, to produce user-independent RNA quality metrics, based on analysis of microcapillary electrophoresis traces. Both provided highly informative and valuable data and the results were found highly correlated, while the RIN system gave more reliable data. The relevance of the RNA quality metrics for assessment of gene expression differences was tested by Q-PCR, revealing a significant decline of the relative expression of genes in RNA samples of disparate quality, while samples of similar, even poor integrity were found highly comparable. We discuss the consequences of these observations to minimize artifactual detection of false positive and negative differential expression due to RNA integrity differences, and propose a scheme for the development of a standard operational procedure, with optional registration of RNA integrity metrics in public repositories of gene expression data.",0
Clinical characteristics and outcome of Penicillium marneffei infection among HIV-infected patients in northern Vietnam,"

This study explains the clinical characteristics and outcomes of Penicillium marneffei infections in HIV-infected patients from northern Vietnam. Penicillium marneffei is a dimorphic fungus that can cause systemic, life-threatening infections among immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. In this region of northern Vietnam, where HIV infection rates are high, P. marneffei has emerged as an important pathogen causing serious illness in resources-limited developing countries. This retrospective observational study evaluates the clinical characteristics and short-term outcome of P. marneffei infection among 54 adult and paediatric patients infected by HIV who were admitted to two designated hospitals between 2014–2019 in the city of Hanoi. The results show that severity of symptoms was mainly mild to moderate and most cases responded favorably to antifungal treatment without significant long term morbidity or mortality at 6 months follow up period; however further surveillance studies should be done for better management for this emerging infectious disease threat among people living with HIV/ AIDS (PLWHA).",1
Cross-subtype Immunity against Avian Influenza in Persons Recently Vaccinated for Influenza,"Avian influenza virus (H5N1) can be transmitted to humans, resulting in a severe or fatal disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian influenza (H5N1) strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal influenza A (H1N1)/(H3N2). A small frequency of CD4 T cells specific for subtype H5N1 was detected in several persons at baseline, and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive CD4 T cells. We also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against influenza (H5N1) in a large number of donors. No correlation between influenza-specific CD4 T cells and humoral responses was observed. N1 may possibly be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type immunity, but additional experiments are needed to clarify this point. These findings highlight the possibility of boosting cross-type cellular and humoral immunity against highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus subtype H5N1 by seasonal influenza vaccination.",0
"Human bocaviruses are highly diverse, dispersed, recombination prone, and prevalent enteric infections","A new species of parvovirus tentatively named human bocavirus 4 (HBoV4) was genetically characterized. Among 641 feces samples from children and adults the most commonly detected bocaviruses species were HBoV2>HBoV3>HBoV4>HBoV1 with HBoV2 prevalence of 21% and 26% in Nigerian and Tunisian children. HBoV3 and HBoV4 species combined were found in 12/192 cases of non-polio acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) from Tunisia and Nigeria and 0/96 healthy Tunisian contacts (p=0.01). Evidence of extensive recombination at the NP1 and VP1 gene boundary between and within species was found. The multiple species and high degree of genetic diversity seen among the human bocaviruses found in feces relative to the highly homogeneous HBoV1 suggest that this world-wide distributed respiratory pathogen may have recently evolved from an enteric bocavirus, perhaps after acquiring an expanded tropism favoring the respiratory track. Elucidating the possible role of the newly identified enteric bocaviruses in human diseases including AFP and diarrhea will require further epidemiological studies.",0
Imaging Findings in Patients With H1N1 Influenza A Infection,"

This paper – 'Imaging Findings in Patients With H1N1 Influenza A Infection' – aims to investigate the clinical relevance, radiological manifestations and outcome of imaging findings in confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza A infections seen at our tertiary care centre. The 2009 pandemic affecting humans caused by a novel H1N1 Influenza A virus brought to attention the varied complications associated with this infection and its immunopathological implications. However, adequate knowledge is yet to be gained with respect to understanding systematic effects on different organs including those related to respiratory system based on objective manifestational evidence. This study looks into radiologic findings in patients suffering from laboratory-confirmed H1N1 influenza A infection admitted and treated at our institute between June 2016 and April 2017, along with analysis of their follow-up imaging results for any possible association between initial clinical presentation and outcome measures. We herein propose that obtaining an accurate understanding of such associations between infectious diseases obtained through radiology will provide valuable insights into pathology as well as prognosis of such viruses thereby aiding medical prevention strategies against epidemics like these in future.",1
Endothelial Cells Support Persistent Gammaherpesvirus 68 Infection,"A variety of human diseases are associated with gammaherpesviruses, including neoplasms of lymphocytes (e.g. Burkitt's lymphoma) and endothelial cells (e.g. Kaposi's sarcoma). Gammaherpesvirus infections usually result in either a productive lytic infection, characterized by expression of all viral genes and rapid cell lysis, or latent infection, characterized by limited viral gene expression and no cell lysis. Here, we report characterization of endothelial cell infection with murine gammaherpesvirus 68 (γHV68), a virus phylogenetically related and biologically similar to the human gammaherpesviruses. Endothelial cells supported γHV68 replication in vitro, but were unique in that a significant proportion of the cells escaped lysis, proliferated, and remained viable in culture for an extended time. Upon infection, endothelial cells became non-adherent and altered in size, complexity, and cell-surface protein expression. These cells were uniformly infected and expressed the lytic transcription program based on detection of abundant viral gene transcripts, GFP fluorescence from the viral genome, and viral surface protein expression. Additionally, endothelial cells continued to produce new infectious virions as late as 30 days post-infection. The outcome of this long-term infection was promoted by the γHV68 v-cyclin, because in the absence of the v-cyclin, viability was significantly reduced following infection. Importantly, infected primary endothelial cells also demonstrated increased viability relative to infected primary fibroblasts, and this increased viability was dependent on the v-cyclin. Finally, we provide evidence for infection of endothelial cells in vivo in immune-deficient mice. The extended viability and virus production of infected endothelial cells indicated that endothelial cells provided a source of prolonged virus production and identify a cell-type specific adaptation of gammaherpesvirus replication. While infected endothelial cells would likely be cleared in a healthy individual, persistently infected endothelial cells could provide a source of continued virus replication in immune-compromised individuals, a context in which gammaherpesvirus-associated pathology frequently occurs.",0
Identifying Live Bird Markets with the Potential to Act as Reservoirs of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) Virus: A Survey in Northern Viet Nam and Cambodia,"

This study presents data on the potential of live bird markets (LBMs) to act as reservoirs of Avian Influenza A (H5N1) virus, surveying 15 LBMs in northern Viet Nam and eight LBMs in Cambodia. Using serological methods, a total of 1614 samples were collected from ducks, chickens and other domestic poultry to detect anti-HA antibodies and identify risk factors associated with these species. The results revealed that three out of 15 LBMs sampled in Viet Nam tested positive for H5N1 antibodies; however, no evidence was found for any infected LBMs from locations surveyed in Cambodia. Additionally, examined variables found an increase invulnerability to infection among birds marketed between October–November than those sold throughout December–January. This survey is significant through providing the first documentations on possible reserves for avian influenza viruses across different animal sources at retail wet markets present throughout Vietnam and CAMBODIA—offering insight into strategies for control towards improving overall human health security worldwide.",1
Quantitative measurement of thyroglobulin mRNA in peripheral blood of patients after total thyroidectomy,"Previous studies have reported the clinical usefulness of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) detection of thyroglobulin (TG) mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma. To evaluate this usefulness, we measured TG mRNA in the peripheral blood of patients diagnosed with thyroid carcinoma after total thyroidectomy by real-time quantitative RT-PCR using glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNA as an internal control. Surprisingly, we detected TG mRNA in all samples obtained after total thyroidectomy, including those from 4 medullary carcinomas. Further, there was no statistical difference in expression levels of TG mRNA in the patients with or without metastasis, and no significant correlation was found between serum TG concentrations and the expression levels of TG mRNA. These results give rise to a question regarding the clinical applications of not only RT-PCR detection but also quantitative measurement of TG mRNA in peripheral blood. © 2001 Cancer Research Campaign http://www.bjcancer.com",0
Activation of the Unfolded Protein Response Is Required for Defenses against Bacterial Pore-Forming Toxin In Vivo,"Pore-forming toxins (PFTs) constitute the single largest class of proteinaceous bacterial virulence factors and are made by many of the most important bacterial pathogens. Host responses to these toxins are complex and poorly understood. We find that the endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated upon exposure to PFTs both in Caenorhabditis elegans and in mammalian cells. Activation of the UPR is protective in vivo against PFTs since animals that lack either the ire-1-xbp-1 or the atf-6 arms of the UPR are more sensitive to PFT than wild-type animals. The UPR acts directly in the cells targeted by the PFT. Loss of the UPR leads to a normal response against unrelated toxins or a pathogenic bacterium, indicating its PFT-protective role is specific. The p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAPK) kinase pathway has been previously shown to be important for cellular defenses against PFTs. We find here that the UPR is one of the key downstream targets of the p38 MAPK pathway in response to PFT since loss of a functional p38 MAPK pathway leads to a failure of PFT to properly activate the ire-1-xbp-1 arm of the UPR. The UPR-mediated activation and response to PFTs is distinct from the canonical UPR-mediated response to unfolded proteins both in terms of its activation and functional sensitivities. These data demonstrate that the UPR, a fundamental intracellular pathway, can operate in intrinsic cellular defenses against bacterial attack.",0
Debate: Transfusing to normal haemoglobin levels will not improve outcome,"Recent evidence suggests that critically ill patients are able to tolerate lower levels of haemoglobin than was previously believed. It is our goal to show that transfusing to a level of 100 g/l does not improve mortality and other clinically important outcomes in a critical care setting. Although many questions remain, many laboratory and clinical studies, including a recent randomized controlled trial (RCT), have established that transfusing to normal haemoglobin concentrations does not improve organ failure and mortality in the critically ill patient. In addition, a restrictive transfusion strategy will reduce exposure to allogeneic transfusions, result in more efficient use of red blood cells (RBCs), save blood overall, and decrease health care costs.",0
Molecular and Microscopic Analysis of Bacteria and Viruses in Exhaled Breath Collected Using a Simple Impaction and Condensing Method,"

The use of noninvasive and simple exhaled breath collection techniques represents an effective alternative for the analysis of bacteria and viruses in clinical studies. In this work, we present a novel technique composed of a simple impaction condensation device coupled with molecular and microscopic analyses for the identification of pathogens within collected condensed particles from exhaled breath. The proposed approach allows rapid sample preparation with minimal human contact when compared to conventional nucleic acid extraction methods. We verified the performance by using samples from nine healthy volunteers containing different strains of bacteria, viruses and other airborne microparticles expelled through coughing episodes. Results indicate high sensitivity and specificity achieved with our developed system, which is suitable for large scale research purposes in clinical settings especially concerning Ebola virus disease (EVD) patients due to its user-friendly protocol that can be implemented safely even at homecare scenarios.",1
Evolution of size and pattern in the social amoebas,"A fundamental goal of biology is to understand how novel phenotypes evolved through changes in existing genes. The Dictyostelia or social amoebas represent a simple form of multicellularity, where starving cells aggregate to build fruiting structures. This review summarizes efforts to provide a framework for investigating the genetic changes that generated novel morphologies in the Dictyostelia. The foundation is a recently constructed molecular phylogeny of the Dictyostelia, which was used to examine trends in the evolution of novel forms and in the divergence of genes that shape these forms. There is a major trend towards the formation of large unbranched fruiting bodies, which is correlated with the use of cyclic AMP (cAMP) as a secreted signal to coordinate cell aggregation. The role of cAMP in aggregation arose through co‐option of a pathway that originally acted to coordinate fruiting body formation. The genotypic changes that caused this innovation and the role of dynamic cAMP signaling in defining fruiting body size and pattern throughout social amoeba evolution are discussed.

The Effectiveness of Contact Tracing in Emerging Epidemics,"BACKGROUND: Contact tracing plays an important role in the control of emerging infectious diseases, but little is known yet about its effectiveness. Here we deduce from a generic mathematical model how effectiveness of tracing relates to various aspects of time, such as the course of individual infectivity, the (variability in) time between infection and symptom-based detection, and delays in the tracing process. In addition, the possibility of iteratively tracing of yet asymptomatic infecteds is considered. With these insights we explain why contact tracing was and will be effective for control of smallpox and SARS, only partially effective for foot-and-mouth disease, and likely not effective for influenza. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We investigate contact tracing in a model of an emerging epidemic that is flexible enough to use for most infections. We consider isolation of symptomatic infecteds as the basic scenario, and express effectiveness as the proportion of contacts that need to be traced for a reproduction ratio smaller than 1. We obtain general results for special cases, which are interpreted with respect to the likely success of tracing for influenza, smallpox, SARS, and foot-and-mouth disease epidemics. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that (1) there is no general predictive formula for the proportion to be traced as there is for the proportion to be vaccinated; (2) variability in time to detection is favourable for effective tracing; (3) tracing effectiveness need not be sensitive to the duration of the latent period and tracing delays; (4) iterative tracing primarily improves effectiveness when single-step tracing is on the brink of being effective.",0
Simple Semantics in Topic Detection and Tracking,"

This paper presents a review of the current state-of-the-art in semantic topic detection and tracking from an interdisciplinary perspective. Focusing primarily on practical applications, we describe the key methods used to acquire and represent text documents, analyse their linguistic features, detect reference topics and events therein, identify changes over time as well as trends emerging across them. Drawing on existing research in natural language processing, information retrieval and knowledge extraction techniques developed by computer scientists we illustrate how robust ontologies can attain high precision through abstract interpretation of facts in combinations with contextual deductions. Furthermore, this study outlines promising approaches to identify nuances between terms that appear semantically related while also highlighting challenges yet to be addressed concerning scalability issues that are crucial for real world implementation. Simple Semantics in Topic Detection and Tracking provides a comprehensive look at these interconnected components of automated content understanding pipeline for data journalists working with large digital text corpuses.",1
"Mortality, Severe Acute Respiratory Infection, and Influenza-Like Illness Associated with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Argentina, 2009"," 

This paper investigates the mortality, severe acute respiratory infection, and influenza-like illness associated with Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in Argentina during 2009. Previous studies have observed varying levels of severity for this virus; however, limited attention has been paid to its effect on the Argentine population specifically. We conducted an observational epidemiological study using local public health records to determine the burden of H1N1 feared by Argentineans at that period. Our results showed a rates of case fatality among those infected with H1N1 significantly higher than typical seasonal flu infections. Additionally, we analyzed hospital data and identified high admission prevalence of adults aged 20-59 before the pandemic peak as well as unusually high mortality rate in young children aged 0-4 as compared to adult deaths due to pneumonia or influenza prior to April 2009. We concluded that despite general success in curtailing cases overall through early intervention strategies involving surveillance activities, anti-viral drugs prophylaxis distribution and active contact tracing efforts there remains concern about spikes within certain age groups from potentially more virulent variants arising from additional infection waves over time which should be monitored closely by public health authorities going forward.

Avian influenza: The tip of the iceberg,"For some years now, we have been living with the fear of an impending pandemic of avian influenza (AI). Despite the recognition, in 1996, of the global threat posed by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus found in farmed geese in Guangdong Province, China, planning for the anticipated epidemic remains woefully inadequate; this is especially true in developing countries such as Saudi Arabia. These deficiencies became obvious in 1997, with the outbreak of AI in the live animal markets in Hong Kong that led to the transmission of infection to 18 humans with close contact with diseased birds; there were six reported deaths.[1] In 2003, with the reemergence of H5N1 (considered the most likely AI virus) in the Republic of Korea and its subsequent spread to Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong and China. Many countries started aggressively making preparations to meet the threat.[2] The pressure for real action from governments has increased. Most developed countries have requested increased funding for the search for a more effective vaccine, for stockpiling possibly helpful antiviral drugs, and for intensifying domestic and global surveillance.[3] Most countries, however, continue to be inadequately prepared for such an epidemic, especially with regard to animal surveillance in the farm market and surveillance among migratory birds. Even now, most countries do not have the ability to detect disease among humans in the early stages of an outbreak nor do most hospitals comply with effective infection control measures that could curtail the spread of the virus in the early stages of an epidemic. In Saudi Arabia we are rapidly implementing many of these measures.[4]",0
Expression of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Virus Capsid Proteins in Silkworm-Baculovirus Expression System and Its Utilization as a Subunit Vaccine,"BACKGROUND: Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease of livestock that causes severe economic loss in susceptible cloven-hoofed animals. Although the traditional inactivated vaccine has been proved effective, it may lead to a new outbreak of FMD because of either incomplete inactivation of FMDV or the escape of live virus from vaccine production workshop. Thus, it is urgent to develop a novel FMDV vaccine that is safer, more effective and more economical than traditional vaccines. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A recombinant silkworm baculovirus Bm-P12A3C which contained the intact P1-2A and 3C protease coding regions of FMDV Asia 1/HNK/CHA/05 was developed. Indirect immunofluorescence test and sandwich-ELISA were used to verify that Bm-P12A3C could express the target cassette. Expression products from silkworm were diluted to 30 folds and used as antigen to immunize cattle. Specific antibody was induced in all vaccinated animals. After challenge with virulent homologous virus, four of the five animals were completely protected, and clinical symptoms were alleviated and delayed in the remaining one. Furthermore, a PD(50) (50% bovine protective dose) test was performed to assess the bovine potency of the subunit vaccine. The result showed the subunit vaccine could achieve 6.34 PD(50) per dose. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that this strategy might be used to develop the new subunit FMDV vaccine.",0
Influenza A: From highly pathogenic H5N1 to pandemic 2009 H1N1. Epidemiology and clinical features,"

This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the epidemiology and clinical features of influenza A, from highly pathogenic H5N1 to pandemic 2009 H1N1. Avian influenza A (H5N1) emerged in 1997, consisting of genetically and antigenically diverse viruses that caused zoonotic infections with high mortality rates, primarily limited to humans exposed to contaminated poultry or poultry environments. Pandemic 2009 H1N1 was first detected in North America in April 2009 and quickly spread worldwide affecting mainly healthy young adults. The novel virus featured a combination of gene segments from avian, human seasonal, and swine origin; its genotype differed markedly from both the 1998 seasonal strain as well as previous pandemics but it resulted mild overall. We describe the evolution of these subtypes based on their corresponding literature review regarding antiviral susceptibility studies combined with epidemiological trends reported by different surveillance systems around the world concluding on common risk factors associated with severe cases among young adults during both epidemic/pandemic outbreaks.",1
Bench-to-bedside review: Angiopoietin signalling in critical illness – a future target?,"Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) occurs in response to major insults such as sepsis, severe haemorrhage, trauma, major surgery and pancreatitis. The mortality rate is high despite intensive supportive care. The pathophysiological mechanism underlying MODS are not entirely clear, although several have been proposed. Overwhelming inflammation, immunoparesis, occult oxygen debt and other mechanisms have been investigated, and – despite many unanswered questions – therapies targeting these mechanisms have been developed. Unfortunately, only a few interventions, usually those targeting multiple mechanisms at the same time, have appeared to be beneficial. We clearly need to understand better the mechanisms that underlie MODS. The endothelium certainly plays an active role in MODS. It functions at the intersection of several systems, including inflammation, coagulation, haemodynamics, fluid and electrolyte balance, and cell migration. An important regulator of these systems is the angiopoietin/Tie2 signalling system. In this review we describe this signalling system, giving special attention to what is known about it in critically ill patients and its potential as a target for therapy.",0
Protein Domain Boundary Predictions: A Structural Biology Perspective,"One of the important fields to apply computational tools for domain boundaries prediction is structural biology. They can be used to design protein constructs that must be expressed in a stable and functional form and must produce diffraction-quality crystals. However, prediction of protein domain boundaries on the basis of amino acid sequences is still very problematical. In present study the performance of several computational approaches are compared. It is observed that the statistical significance of most of the predictions is rather poor. Nevertheless, when the right number of domains is correctly predicted, domain boundaries are predicted within very few residues from their real location. It can be concluded that prediction methods cannot be used yet as routine tools in structural biology, though some of them are rather promising.",0
The public perception of the value of vaccines - the case of Switzerland,"

This paper discusses the public perception of the value of vaccines in Switzerland. The research aims to examine how people living in Switzerland assess the benefits and risks associated with vaccinating children, as well as their views on government-mandated vaccination policies. To analyze this data effectively, a mixed methods approach is utilized to gather quantitative data from a questionnaire survey with Swiss citizens and qualitative interviews from healthcare professionals working within the country. Results reveal that there are discrepancies between observed behaviors and attitudes towards vaccine uptake by both parents and health providers. Furthermore, overall support for mandated vaccine policy appears largely dependent upon participants’ perceived benefits vs. potential side-effects/risks associated with each condition targeted by such legislation. The findings will help policymakers better understand current public sentiment regarding immunization practices in Switzerland and make more informed decisions about investment into related initiatives targeting elements like childhood exposure or parent education programs which could shape future attitudes around these matters..",1
Epidemiological and clinical characteristics of childhood pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus infection: an observational cohort study,"

""Epidemiological and Clinical Characteristics of Childhood Pandemic 2009 H1N1 Virus Infection: An Observational Cohort Study"" examines the clinical features, disease manifestations, and outcomes in children who were infected with pandemic-associated influenza A (H1N1) virus during 2009. During this season it was estimated that between 11%-21% of symptomatic global population suffered from this seasonal outbreak. Despite widespread availability of both prophylactic as well as treatment measures like neuraminidase inhibitors available for disease control; major morbidity occurred amongst pediatric populations due to different epidemiological profiles compared to adults associated with the novel pandemic strain. The objective of this prospective observational cohort study is to investigate epidemiologically related factors along with clinical characteristics among hospitalized pediatric patients towards ascertaining the severity markers associated with severe cases leading to worse prognosis in an attempt towards identifying targets for improved management protocols. The findings from such investigations will reflect upon greater insight on childhood infection induced by H1N1virus paving a path for future preventive therapeutics against significant worldwide events involving novel emerging viruses.",1
Epigrass: a tool to study disease spread in complex networks,"BACKGROUND: The construction of complex spatial simulation models such as those used in network epidemiology, is a daunting task due to the large amount of data involved in their parameterization. Such data, which frequently resides on large geo-referenced databases, has to be processed and assigned to the various components of the model. All this just to construct the model, then it still has to be simulated and analyzed under different epidemiological scenarios. This workflow can only be achieved efficiently by computational tools that can automate most, if not all, these time-consuming tasks. In this paper, we present a simulation software, Epigrass, aimed to help designing and simulating network-epidemic models with any kind of node behavior. RESULTS: A Network epidemiological model representing the spread of a directly transmitted disease through a bus-transportation network connecting mid-size cities in Brazil. Results show that the topological context of the starting point of the epidemic is of great importance from both control and preventive perspectives. CONCLUSION: Epigrass is shown to facilitate greatly the construction, simulation and analysis of complex network models. The output of model results in standard GIS file formats facilitate the post-processing and analysis of results by means of sophisticated GIS software.",0

Prospective application of clinician-performed lung ultrasonography during the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic: distinguishing viral from bacterial pneumonia," 

This paper addresses the prospective utility of clinician-performed lung ultrasonography (US) during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic to distinguish viral from bacterial pneumonia. The ability for clinicians to easily assess and differentiate between bacterial and viral pneumonias is essential in determining appropriate treatment. However, there has previously been a limited understanding of US’s role in management during influenza A epidemics. We therefore sought to systematically evaluate whether clinician-performed lung US may lead to accurate identification of etiology and improve patient care during this historic healthcare crisis. Herein we present a retrospective analysis conducted over five months that employed cohort study designs at two Chinese university hospitals for 176 adult patients with documented positive clinical diagnoses confirmed via RT-PCR tests, combined with historical control group data collected three weeks before the pandemic emergence of novel virus strain AH3N2H1N1/09 on April 27th 2009. The primary outcome measure was accurate diagnosis rates compared across groups using biomedical techniques including chest X-ray film imaging with linear measurements and B lines diagnostic sign determination coupled with point-of-care bedside clinicians performing transthoracic lung US examinations which were subjectively scored according figures 0 through 7 according International Classification of Diseases 10 supplementations criteria. We concluded that visceroelastance distortion discrimination by sonographical testing might be a reliable way in differentiating between viral or bacterial pneumonias especially when controlling factors such as ambient air pollution levels can interfere image assessment accuracy both through traditional photography comparison technique or computer aided machine learning quantitative interpretation methods are taken into account due its higher sensitivity capability than any other method described heretofore had scientifically proven so far yet were not able detect those aforementioned external influence fluctuations phenomenons which can alter rheological properties thus leading misdiagnosis potential events whenever frequent based monitoring is required in variable environmental circumstances encountered settings routine basis evaluation matters highly must keep under consideration our current findings attempt more comprehensive endeavor look advancement actual needs nearby future should investigate carefully recommendations suggested current contribution become major integral component further researches altogether studies done field order wider better possible outcomes complete global public health prevention strategies perspective applications clinician performed ultrasound pandemics specifically HENIN Influenza hereby discussed showcased being worth following up research agenda properly detailed elaborated regard future step encouraging outreach vulnerable populations ongoing assistance organized supervise related initiatives focus ensuring most powerful fully feasible outcomes stemming respective preventions policies deployment urbanized developing countries worldwide appreciate acknowledgements greatly regards give thanks work continued collaboration efforts made date extend fullest gratitude all parties involved merit kindly come follow support us propose widely informed discussions constructive actions lasting effects stakeholders have take upon hopes success reported herein shall fundamental contribution worldwide medical community being whole hospital dedicated places globally providing safest best civil personnel remains utmost priority these approaches brought light summation now stands foremost issue hand ample guidance confront similar conundrums ever occur again lest forget even most researched rational aspects life saving treatments shareable merits benefits citizenry overall safety collective consequence collaborative socioecologic approach degree interconnectivity nations face common front apocalyptic occurrences alike manner thoroughly implement strategies currently proposed steady stability if appropriate extent reached timely fashion meanwhile imperative undertake value continue investment trends argued presented body literature then ultimately fulfilled obligations chosen set clear guidelines correctly distantly inherited evidence soon arrived arrival times pertinence resolute establishments arrangements believe none matter relevancy deep rooted theorization considerations allow efficient operations sustainable daily lifestyle choices bring forth magnificent accomplishments together whatever reasonable measures forthcame full scale burdensome prepositions implementation end hopefully forthcoming arise uncoverings fully exposed mighty jewels every justly honorably accomplished task carries greater lights entire humanity forward triumphant conquest historically pathbreaking feats inception distinction diverse eras generations superiority legacy established institutes alongside mission achieve excellence science laboratory realm proved undeniable true directions new age dawn outshine putative glimmers let evident become crystal clear unshakeable rock faith enduring reaffirm essence within transient moments eternity momentary flicker infinite promised luster fortune favor paths uncrossed unsurmountable zeniths triumphal hymns sung stories written heroic song lauding victorious vanquishers immeasurably fathomless bournes akin legendary sea rarely yearly recounted multitudinous clamors greatness humanities hallmarks fulfill aspirations addendum",1
Influenza A Virus Inhibits Type I IFN Signaling via NF-κB-Dependent Induction of SOCS-3 Expression,"The type I interferon (IFN) system is a first line of defense against viral infections. Viruses have developed various mechanisms to counteract this response. So far, the interferon antagonistic activity of influenza A viruses was mainly observed on the level of IFNβ gene induction via action of the viral non-structural protein 1 (NS1). Here we present data indicating that influenza A viruses not only suppress IFNβ gene induction but also inhibit type I IFN signaling through a mechanism involving induction of the suppressor of cytokine signaling-3 (SOCS-3) protein. Our study was based on the observation that in cells that were infected with influenza A virus and subsequently stimulated with IFNα/β, phosphorylation of the signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 1 (STAT1) was strongly reduced. This impaired STAT1 activation was not due to the action of viral proteins but rather appeared to be induced by accumulation of viral 5′ triphosphate RNA in the cell. SOCS proteins are potent endogenous inhibitors of Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT signaling. Closer examination revealed that SOCS-3 but not SOCS-1 mRNA levels increase in an RNA- and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)-dependent but type I IFN-independent manner early in the viral replication cycle. This direct viral induction of SOCS-3 mRNA and protein expression appears to be relevant for suppression of the antiviral response since in SOCS-3 deficient cells a sustained phosphorylation of STAT1 correlated with elevated expression of type I IFN-dependent genes. As a consequence, progeny virus titers were reduced in SOCS-3 deficient cells or in cells were SOCS-3 expression was knocked-down by siRNA. These data provide the first evidence that influenza A viruses suppress type I IFN signaling on the level of JAK/STAT activation. The inhibitory effect is at least in part due to the induction of SOCS-3 gene expression, which results in an impaired antiviral response.",0

"Screening for Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, Auckland International Airport, New Zealand","

This study looks at the prevalence of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 in travellers using Auckland International Airport, New Zealand. Screening methods were used to determine the rate of infection for symptomatic and asymptomatic passengers entering and exiting the airport during a four-month period. Results indicate that there is an increased risk for infection through international transit amongst individuals aged 18-25 years old travelling from certain countries due to their higher likelihood of exposure to Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 abroad. These findings further support evidence suggesting that airports should consider implementing health screenings on all incoming international flights to reduce transmission in a nation’s population.",1
Hairpin structure within the 3′UTR of DNA polymerase β mRNA acts as a post-transcriptional regulatory element and interacts with Hax-1,"Aberrant expression of DNA polymerase β, a key enzyme involved in base excision repair, leads to genetic instability and carcinogenesis. Pol β expression has been previously shown to be regulated at the level of transcription, but there is also evidence of post-transcriptional regulation, since rat transcripts undergo alternative polyadenylation, and the resulting 3′UTR contain at least one regulatory element. Data presented here indicate that RNA of the short 3′UTR folds to form a strong secondary structure (hairpin). Its regulatory role was established utilizing a luciferase-based reporter system. Further studies led to the identification of a protein factor, which binds to this element—the anti-apoptotic, cytoskeleton-related protein Hax-1. The results of in vitro binding analysis indicate that the formation of the RNA–protein complex is significantly impaired by disruption of the hairpin motif. We demonstrate that Hax-1 binds to Pol β mRNA exclusively in the form of a dimer. Biochemical analysis revealed the presence of Hax-1 in mitochondria, but also in the nuclear matrix, which, along with its transcript-binding properties, suggests that Hax-1 plays a role in post-transcriptional regulation of expression of Pol β.",0
"3D QSAR Pharmacophore Modeling, in Silico Screening, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) Approaches for Identification of Human Chymase Inhibitors","

This article presents a comprehensive overview of the application of 3D QSAR pharmacophore modeling, in silico screening, and Density Functional Theory (DFT) approaches to identify potential human chymase inhibitors.  Chymases are serine proteases and differ from other types of enzymes due to their uniquely active site architecture and catalytic triad - making them a relatively unexplored drug target for clinical use. A combination of computational chemistry protocols have been employed together with available experimental data to take advantage of their unique features through various bioinformatics pathways. This novel approach could lead the way forward towards clinically relevant molecules that provide treatment for several cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension or heart failure associated with increased levels of chymase activity.",1
Model-Based Design of Growth-Attenuated Viruses,"Live-virus vaccines activate both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, require only a single boosting, and generally provide longer immune protection than killed or subunit vaccines. However, growth of live-virus vaccines must be attenuated to minimize their potential pathogenic effects, and mechanisms of attenuation by conventional serial-transfer viral adaptation are not well-understood. New methods of attenuation based on rational engineering of viral genomes may offer a potentially greater control if one can link defined genetic modifications to changes in virus growth. To begin to establish such links between genotype and growth phenotype, we developed a computer model for the intracellular growth of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a well-studied, nonsegmented, negative-stranded RNA virus. Our model incorporated established regulatory mechanisms of VSV while integrating key wild-type infection steps: hijacking of host resources, transcription, translation, and replication, followed by assembly and release of progeny VSV particles. Generalization of the wild-type model to allow for genome rearrangements matched the experimentally observed attenuation ranking for recombinant VSV strains that altered the genome position of their nucleocapsid gene. Finally, our simulations captured previously reported experimental results showing how altering the positions of other VSV genes has the potential to attenuate the VSV growth while overexpressing the immunogenic VSV surface glycoprotein. Such models will facilitate the engineering of new live-virus vaccines by linking genomic manipulations to controlled changes in virus gene-expression and growth.",0
Proteomics Comparison of Cerebrospinal Fluid of Relapsing Remitting and Primary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis,"BACKGROUND: Based on clinical representation of disease symptoms multiple sclerosis (MScl) patients can be divided into two major subtypes; relapsing remitting (RR) MScl (85–90%) and primary progressive (PP) MScl (10–15%). Proteomics analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has detected a number of proteins that were elevated in MScl patients. Here we specifically aimed to differentiate between the PP and RR subtypes of MScl by comparing CSF proteins. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CSF samples (n = 31) were handled according to the same protocol for quantitative mass spectrometry measurements we reported previously. In the comparison of PP MScl versus RR MScl we observed a number of differentially abundant proteins, such as protein jagged-1 and vitamin D-binding protein. Protein jagged-1 was over three times less abundant in PP MScl compared to RR MScl. Vitamin D-binding protein was only detected in the RR MScl samples. These two proteins were validated by independent techniques (western blot and ELISA) as differentially abundant in the comparison between both MScl types. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The main finding of this comparative study is the observation that the proteome profiles of CSF in PP and RR MScl patients overlap to a large extent. Still, a number of differences could be observed. Protein jagged-1 is a ligand for multiple Notch receptors and involved in the mediation of Notch signaling. It is suggested in literature that the Notch pathway is involved in the remyelination of MScl lesions. Aberration of normal homeostasis of Vitamin D, of which approximately 90% is bound to vitamin D-binding protein, has been widely implicated in MScl for some years now. Vitamin D directly and indirectly regulates the differentiation, activation of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and can prevent the development of autoimmune processes, and so it may be involved in neuroprotective elements in MScl.",0
Asymmetry in the Presence of Migration Stabilizes Multistrain Disease Outbreaks,"We study the effect of migration between coupled populations, or patches, on the stability properties of multistrain disease dynamics. The epidemic model used in this work displays a Hopf bifurcation to oscillations in a single, well-mixed population. It is shown numerically that migration between two non-identical patches stabilizes the endemic steady state, delaying the onset of large amplitude outbreaks and reducing the total number of infections. This result is motivated by analyzing generic Hopf bifurcations with different frequencies and with diffusive coupling between them. Stabilization of the steady state is again seen, indicating that our observation in the full multistrain model is based on qualitative characteristics of the dynamics rather than on details of the disease model.",0
Novel Method for Isolation of Murine Clara Cell Secretory Protein-Expressing Cells with Traces of Stemness,"

This paper focuses on a novel method for the isolation of murine clara cell secretory protein-expressing cells with traces of stemness. In the realm of lung biology, the knowledge about airway lining epithelial properties and its heterogeneity greatly influences our understanding of diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). As such, accurate description of various specialized pulmonary epithelia is essential which can be better achieved through appropriate cellular models that show distinct histological features. This study presents an optimized protocol to isolate functional Clara Cell Secretory Protein (CCSP)-expressing alveolar type II cell progenitors from mouse lungs in combination with their integration flows within many other context applications, including long-term culture protocols for specific omics studies. The best results have been obtained using immunofluorescence approach combined with flow cytometry analysis employing CD45-FLK1 DCX double positive markers along with CCSP staining technique generating high viable single cells featuring traceable stemness potential enabling the use in wide scale genomics projects.",1
Cloning and Sequence Analysis of the Nucleocapsid Gene of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Chinju99,"

The devastating nature of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDV) and its ongoing impact on pig farms worldwide has driven the requirement for more precise medical approaches in controlling this virus. To address this issue, a team from China aimed to clone and sequence the nucleocapsid gene of PEDV strain Chinju99. Using a combination of reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and rapid amplification strategies, the study successfully cloned, sequenced and analysed the full length cDNA segment coding for M protein from PEDV Chinju99 strain. Through further analysis it was determined that there were several mutations within this region which provided new insight into routes of transmission used by this particular strain as well as providing clues towards improved therapeutical applications designed to target specific mutations present in PEDV strains. In conclusion, these findings support critical research into better ways to control vial outbreaks of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus through molecular level understanding at genetic level. This article presents an in-depth cloning and sequencing analysis of the Nucleocapsid Gene OF Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus Chinju99 revealing novel insights regarding strain structure variants.'",1
The role of mast cells in the pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis,BACKGROUND: The biological basis of pain in chronic pancreatitis is poorly understood. Mast cells have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pain in other conditions. We hypothesized that mast cells play a role in the pain of chronic pancreatitis. We examined the association of pain with mast cells in autopsy specimens of patients with painful chronic pancreatitis. We explored our hypothesis further using an experimental model of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) -induced chronic pancreatitis in both wild type (WT) and mast cell deficient mice (MCDM). METHODS: Archival tissues with histological diagnoses of chronic pancreatitis were identified and clinical records reviewed for presence or absence of reported pain in humans. Mast cells were counted. The presence of pain was assessed using von Frey Filaments (VFF) to measure abdominal withdrawal responses in both WT and MCDM mice with and without chronic pancreatitis. RESULTS: Humans with painful chronic pancreatitis demonstrated a 3.5-fold increase in pancreatic mast cells as compared with those with painless chronic pancreatitis. WT mice with chronic pancreatitis were significantly more sensitive as assessed by VFF pain testing of the abdomen when compared with MCDM. CONCLUSION: Humans with painful chronic pancreatitis have an increased number of pancreatic mast cells as compared with those with painless chronic pancreatitis. MCDM are less sensitive to mechanical stimulation of the abdomen after induction of chronic pancreatitis as compared with WT. Mast cells may play an important role in the pathogenesis of pain in chronic pancreatitis.,0
"Spatial dynamics of the 1918 influenza pandemic in England, Wales and the United States","There is still limited understanding of key determinants of spatial spread of influenza. The 1918 pandemic provides an opportunity to elucidate spatial determinants of spread on a large scale. To better characterize the spread of the 1918 major wave, we fitted a range of city-to-city transmission models to mortality data collected for 246 population centres in England and Wales and 47 cities in the US. Using a gravity model for city-to-city contacts, we explored the effect of population size and distance on the spread of disease and tested assumptions regarding density dependence in connectivity between cities. We employed Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to estimate parameters of the model for population, infectivity, distance and density dependence. We inferred the most likely transmission trees for both countries. For England and Wales, a model that estimated the degree of density dependence in connectivity between cities was preferable by deviance information criterion comparison. Early in the major wave, long distance infective interactions predominated, with local infection events more likely as the epidemic became widespread. For the US, with fewer more widely dispersed cities, statistical power was lacking to estimate population size dependence or the degree of density dependence, with the preferred model depending on distance only. We find that parameters estimated from the England and Wales dataset can be applied to the US data with no likelihood penalty.",0
Clinical review: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis acute exacerbations - unravelling Ariadne's thread,"

This clinical review presents an analysis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) acute exacerbations - major events that can cause a rapid decline in lung function and make prognoses difficult to predict. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive and fatal disease characterised by the deposition of extracellular matrix in the alveoli, undergone by approximately 5 million people worldwide. Its management demands careful treatment decisions as well as advanced diagnostic tools for early detection. Understanding IPF acute exacerbations has been a challenging task due to their heterogeneous nature and lack of validated biomarkers of inflammation or infection associated with them. To complicate matters further, continuous developments in its diagnosis require the frequent evaluation of therapeutic strategies for IPF patients suffering from those episodes including established approaches or novel formulations such as antifibrotics are receiving promising effectiveness results on regression but still need further deep research. This paper will explore Ariadne's thread within this labyrinthine thicket through reviewing both literature reports and personal experience, appraisal valid therapeutical alternatives against insidiousness behaviour exhibited during these acutisations\ while also providing an insightful approach towards global efforts to declass yet another medical mystery surrounding modern medicine.",1
Immunogenetic Factors Associated with Severe Respiratory Illness Caused by Zoonotic H1N1 and H5N1 Influenza Viruses,"

This study examines the immunogenetic factors associated with severe respiratory illness caused by zoonotic H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses. In a world where these dangerous viruses are rapidly evolving, understanding innate immune responses and corresponding genetic variations will be key to providing effective treatments for those most vulnerable to global pandemics of this magnitude. We have systematically used genomic screening techniques and epidemiological studies to identify clinical associations between specific genetic variants of cytokine receptors, lymphocyte subsets, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene repertoires, Fc receptor polymorphisms, antibody production variables and other antigen-presenting molecules in individuals who were infected with either virus strain. Our research aims to shed light on how their interaction can affect host resistance or susceptibility towards such pathogenic strains of influenza A viruses during an outbreak.",1
The Dispanins: A Novel Gene Family of Ancient Origin That Contains 14 Human Members,"

This study investigates a novel gene family of ancient origin, known as the Dispanins. With fourteen human members (Dspns), the Dispanins are one of the oldest multi-gene families to be identified in mammals, and their distinct roles are predicted to offer important insights into mammalian evolution. A comprehensive analysis was undertaken using bioinformatics tools to identify all Human Dspn subtypes along with functional aspects including conservation and expression levels across multiple species. An exploration of evolutionary relationships highlights variations among phylogenetic classifications interpreting their roles in a variety of mammalian pathways and processes. This illuminating review provides initial evidence on salient features associated with this unique gene family most relevant for further research into those underlying mechanisms related to mammalian diversification and adaptation throughout our evolutionary history.",1
Evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions using dextran- and mannan–dextran-coated USPIO: MRI analysis and pathological findings,"

This paper presents an in-depth evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions and their associated characteristics, such as arterial wall thickness, necrotic core size, and inflammatory cells count through Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis combined with pathological findings after administering Ultrasmall Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide nanoparticles (USPIO), coated with either dextran or mannan–dextran. The use of USPIO as contrast material for MRI has become increasingly important due to its unique properties; this procedure allows the identification of alterations in tissue structure that could not have been easily obtained before. Additionally, intra-observer variability was analysed to evaluate the accuracy of this specific technique. Our results suggest a satisfactory agreement between the various techniques used; however they also show some discrepancies which can be discussed further. Therefore, we imply that further studies are needed to improve the accuracy of USPIO administered by improving labeling agents molecules affinity towards the lesion tissues and sensitivity inside the MRI scanner, allowing us to discover more information about these structures",1
Oral application of cytokines,"

This study seeks to explore the potential for oral application of cytokines and their therapeutic effects. Cytokines are a family of proteins essential for regulating immune response, maintaining tissue homoeostasis, and coordinating cell growth and development. Despite impressive progress in research, few studies have focused on using oral delivery as a means to trigger these processes. The objective of this investigation is to survey the structure and functionality of various types of cytokines suitable for administration via an oral route, compare the efficacy between different methods used in delivering them by mouth, investigate whether therapeutic outcomes occur when targeting conditions enabled by each type of cytokine presented with associated risks or limitations that could affect clearance following treatment. The primary endpoints are safety profiles ensured by established criteria based on pharmacokinetic parameters, as well as targeted organ protection and changes in biochemical markers post-intervention. Ultimately it is hoped that results from this project will provide insights into new approaches involving orally administered molecules which may effectively reduce inflammation or increase systemic immunity without significant side effects or drug toxicity levels reported in standard treatments such as infusion therapy or immunoregulatory agents",1
Predicting Drug-Target Interaction Networks Based on Functional Groups and Biological Features,"BACKGROUND: Study of drug-target interaction networks is an important topic for drug development. It is both time-consuming and costly to determine compound-protein interactions or potential drug-target interactions by experiments alone. As a complement, the in silico prediction methods can provide us with very useful information in a timely manner. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To realize this, drug compounds are encoded with functional groups and proteins encoded by biological features including biochemical and physicochemical properties. The optimal feature selection procedures are adopted by means of the mRMR (Maximum Relevance Minimum Redundancy) method. Instead of classifying the proteins as a whole family, target proteins are divided into four groups: enzymes, ion channels, G-protein- coupled receptors and nuclear receptors. Thus, four independent predictors are established using the Nearest Neighbor algorithm as their operation engine, with each to predict the interactions between drugs and one of the four protein groups. As a result, the overall success rates by the jackknife cross-validation tests achieved with the four predictors are 85.48%, 80.78%, 78.49%, and 85.66%, respectively. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results indicate that the network prediction system thus established is quite promising and encouraging.",0
"From Functional Genomics to Functional Immunomics: New Challenges, Old Problems, Big Rewards","The development of DNA microarray technology a decade ago led to the establishment of functional genomics as one of the most active and successful scientific disciplines today. With the ongoing development of immunomic microarray technology—a spatially addressable, large-scale technology for measurement of specific immunological response—the new challenge of functional immunomics is emerging, which bears similarities to but is also significantly different from functional genomics. Immunonic data has been successfully used to identify biological markers involved in autoimmune diseases, allergies, viral infections such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza, diabetes, and responses to cancer vaccines. This review intends to provide a coherent vision of this nascent scientific field, and speculate on future research directions. We discuss at some length issues such as epitope prediction, immunomic microarray technology and its applications, and computation and statistical challenges related to functional immunomics. Based on the recent discovery of regulation mechanisms in T cell responses, we envision the use of immunomic microarrays as a tool for advances in systems biology of cellular immune responses, by means of immunomic regulatory network models.",0
Human Bocavirus – Insights into a Newly Identified Respiratory Virus,"

This study provides comprehensive insight into Human Bocavirus (HBoV), a recently discovered respiratory virus. HBoV is an important emerging pathogen in infants and young children, causing severe bronchiolitis-like symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and fever. There is increasing evidence of the involvement of HBoV in other acute respiratory syndromes worldwide besides bronchiolitis, but further research on its prevalence, clinical presentation and genetic diversity has been limited. This paper aims to review recent progress regarding the epidemiology, transmission route, clinical impact, risk factors for infection and laboratory diagnostic methods for this novel virus. Results obtained from this work can help promote early diagnosis with proper monitoring measures to prevent potential complications associated with HBoV infection making it an important current topic in public health inquiry.",1
Ebola Virion Attachment and Entry into Human Macrophages Profoundly Effects Early Cellular Gene Expression,"

'Ebola virion attachment and entry into human macrophages profoundly effects early cellular gene expression': The Ebolavirus is a highly contagious virus that causes serious illness in humans and other primates. It belongs to the family Filoviridae, which consists of three genera – Marburgvirus, Cuevavirus and Ebolavirus itself. During infection, the virus uses its glycoproteins to enable binding onto host cells so they can be endocytosed by the cell membrane and actively penetrate them – a process known as ""virion attachment and entry."" This study focused on evaluating how this vital step of infection impacted immediate cellular activities within the cell. Using an integrated analysis across multiple omics data sets including transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics and metabolomics profiling assays we sought to gain a systematic understanding of how EBV hijacks key functions such as transcriptional regulation upon entering human macrophaging. Further analyses detected a wide spectrum alterations induced by EBV-associated gene products at early stages in simulated infections of primary monocyte-derived macrophages at high multiplicities associated with pathogenesis. Our experimental models suggest that after fusion of endosomes containing viral components with cytoplasmic organelles additional responses are initiated resulting in upregulation or downregulation for many genes involved in infiltrative pathways for immune system evasion strategies used by ebola viruses against their hosts during acute phase infections . In conclusion our results emphasize ephemeral changes occurring immediately after endothelial/macrophage invasion leading to devastating outcomes not just limited to Ebola Virus but also potentially relevant to certain other filoviral diseases like Lassa Fever Virus (LFV) as well.",1
Methods for counting particles in microfluidic applications,"

This paper presents a comprehensive review of particle counting techniques for microfluidic applications. With the introduction of novel technologies in this field, the need for precise and reliable methods to count particles is growing rapidly. This paper evaluates common particle-counting techniques including manual counting, optical microscopy and image processing, along with more recent methods such as electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and dielectrophoresis (DEP). Additionally, new methods developed specifically for microfluidic applications are discussed. These include fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), dynamic light scattering (DLS), Raman imaging spectroscopy (RIS) and scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM). Their advantages, drawbacks and potential uses are detailed. Finally, future directions in research will be addressed so as to maximize accuracy and diminish errors when using any given particle - counting method in a microfluidic system.",1
Predictive and Reactive Distribution of Vaccines and Antivirals during Cross-Regional Pandemic Outbreaks,"

This paper presents an evaluation of the efficacy of predictive and reactive distribution models in the context of cross-regional pandemic outbreaks. Drawing upon data from a series of outbreak simulations, the authors examine how well geographic considerations are taken into account when applying both preventive strategies, while further exploring which factors have to be considered for obtaining optimal results. Analysis is conducted as to whether vaccination or antiviral therapy provide superior effectiveness in controlling a pandemic spread. Such findings may lead to improved management strategies being available in future pandemics by enabling public health policy makers with more effective distribution tools at their disposal.",1
Differential Regulation of Type I Interferon and Epidermal Growth Factor Pathways by a Human Respirovirus Virulence Factor,"A number of paramyxoviruses are responsible for acute respiratory infections in children, elderly and immuno-compromised individuals, resulting in airway inflammation and exacerbation of chronic diseases like asthma. To understand the molecular pathogenesis of these infections, we searched for cellular targets of the virulence protein C of human parainfluenza virus type 3 (hPIV3-C). We found that hPIV3-C interacts directly through its C-terminal domain with STAT1 and GRB2, whereas C proteins from measles or Nipah viruses failed to do so. Binding to STAT1 explains the previously reported capacity of hPIV3-C to block type I interferon signaling, but the interaction with GRB2 was unexpected. This adaptor protein bridges Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) receptor to MAPK/ERK pathway, a signaling cascade recently found to be involved in airway inflammatory response. We report that either hPIV3 infection or transient expression of hPIV3-C both increase cellular response to EGF, as assessed by Elk1 transactivation and phosphorylation levels of ERK1/2, 40S ribosomal subunit protein S6 and translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). Furthermore, inhibition of MAPK/ERK pathway with U0126 prevented viral protein expression in infected cells. Altogether, our data provide molecular basis to explain the role of hPIV3-C as a virulence factor and determinant of pathogenesis and demonstrate that Paramyxoviridae have evolved a single virulence factor to block type I interferon signaling and to boost simultaneous cellular response to growth factors.",0
Niclosamide Is a Proton Carrier and Targets Acidic Endosomes with Broad Antiviral Effects,"

This study examines the utility of niclosamide as a proton carrier in targeting acidic endosomes, and its broad antiviral effects. Niclosamide is an antiparasitic drug that has been employed for decades to eliminate intestinal worms. Recent evidence suggests it may also prove effective against various viruses including Influenza A, HIV-1 and Zika virus. The mechanism by which it affects viral replication remains largely unknown; however, current theories focus on niclosamide's potential role as a proton shuttle for delivering molecules across cellular membranes into endosomal compartments with controlled pH levels. Moreover, studies have demonstrated that delivery of drugs normally targeted to acidified lysosome-like structures can be improved when accompanied by this amphiphilic compound because of its ability to localize at low pHs within these organelles due to the ""proton sponge"" effect. This investigation therefore explores how niclosamide acts upon various types of viruses while considering its efficacy in directing drug activity through modulating membrane charge/polarity states as well as exploiting natural osmotic gradients between intracellular vesicles and their surroundings. Ultimately we aim to explain why niclosamide may represent a promising tool with broad antiviral applications against some of the most concerning human pathogens worldwide today",1
Prognosis of hospitalized patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza in Spain: influence of neuraminidase inhibitors,"

The timely availability of effective treatments for infectious diseases has a significant influence on the outcomes of patients. This study aims to evaluate the prognosis of hospitalized patients with 2009 H1N1 influenza in Spain and to analyze the effect of neuraminidase inhibitors, one of the main antiviral therapies used against influenza virus infection. Retrospective analysis was conducted over six years on 3,776 individuals diagnosed with or confirmed as having tested positive for 2009 H1N1 flu admitted into 27 Spanish hospitals across all Autonomous Communities from January 2013 until December 2018. Results demonstrate that neuraminidase inhibitors significantly affect survival and length-of-stay intervals among affected individuals who required intensive care units (ICUs), but their impact is less significant outside the ICU environment. Findings highlight how critical it is to utilize these medications when treating patients infected with 2009 H1N1 influenza within hospital settings in order to maximize patient recovery and reduce mortality rates associated with infections caused by this virus.",1
Feline Immunodeficiency Virus in South America,"

The prevalence and outbreak of Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) has caused a significant loss in cat populations across the world. In order to understand the particular impact of this virus on cats within South America, a survey was conducted among veterinarians working in three countries: Brazil, Chile and Argentina. The purpose of this experiment was to generate an accurate understanding of how many cats are currently infected with FIV as well as which demographic groups both contract and succumb more frequently to the effects of the virus. Our results provide evidence for increased risk factors associated with outdoor activity rate and neutering status amongst the surveyed cat population. This analysis can be used by animal centers resources across South America to inform policies related to care-taking measures that will help mitigate against further spread of this debilitating disease by targeting specific regions or demographics that may be impacted disproportionately due to their living situation or lifestyle habits.",1
Presentation of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis due to a novel MUNC 13–4 mutation masked by partial therapeutic immunosuppression,"

This study examines the presentation of an unusually severe hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) case in a nine-year old pediatric patient, caused by a novel mutation in MUNC 13–4, which was inadvertently masked due to partial therapeutic immunosuppression. Through comprehensive genetic and phenotypic analyses, we will present data on this rare clinical condition and discuss potential treatments for HLH associated with this particular mutation.",1
A Chinese Herbal Formula to Improve General Psychological Status in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Trial on Sichuan Earthquake Survivors,"

The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness and safety of a traditional Chinese herbal formula (Bai Tou Pian) in improving general psychological status in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The trial included 135 survivors from the 2008 Sichuan earthquake who were randomly assigned to either an intervention group or a placebo group. After 15 weeks, the self-reported questionnaires revealed improvements on psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety and sleep disturbances compared to baseline scores for participants receiving the active treatment. Daily symptom monitoring showed no significant difference between groups during follow-up observations indicating that Bai Tou Pian is safe and well tolerated. These results suggest that Bai Tou Pian may provide promising clinical benefit for PTSD evidence by reducing psychological symptoms as well as promoting improved quality of life for trauma sufferers with satisfactory tolerance profiles.",1
Involvement of microRNAs in physiological and pathological processes in the lung,"To date, at least 900 different microRNA (miRNA) genes have been discovered in the human genome. These short, single-stranded RNA molecules originate from larger precursor molecules that fold to produce hairpin structures, which are subsequently processed by ribonucleases Drosha/Pasha and Dicer to form mature miRNAs. MiRNAs play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of about one third of human genes, mainly via degradation of target mRNAs. Whereas the target mRNAs are often involved in the regulation of diverse physiological processes ranging from developmental timing to apoptosis, miRNAs have a strong potential to regulate fundamental biological processes also in the lung compartment. However, the knowledge of the role of miRNAs in physiological and pathological conditions in the lung is still limited. This review, therefore, summarizes current knowledge of the mechanism, function of miRNAs and their contribution to lung development and homeostasis. Besides the involvement of miRNAs in pulmonary physiological conditions, there is evidence that abnormal miRNA expression may lead to pathological processes and development of various pulmonary diseases. Next, the review describes current state-of-art on the miRNA expression profiles in smoking-related diseases including lung cancerogenesis, in immune system mediated pulmonary diseases and fibrotic processes in the lung. From the current research it is evident that miRNAs may play role in the posttranscriptional regulation of key genes in human pulmonary diseases. Further studies are, therefore, necessary to explore miRNA expression profiles and their association with target mRNAs in human pulmonary diseases.",0
Bioinformatic mapping of AlkB homology domains in viruses,"BACKGROUND: AlkB-like proteins are members of the 2-oxoglutarate- and Fe(II)-dependent oxygenase superfamily. In Escherichia coli the protein protects RNA and DNA against damage from methylating agents. 1-methyladenine and 3-methylcytosine are repaired by oxidative demethylation and direct reversal of the methylated base back to its unmethylated form. Genes for AlkB homologues are widespread in nature, and Eukaryotes often have several genes coding for AlkB-like proteins. Similar domains have also been observed in certain plant viruses. The function of the viral domain is unknown, but it has been suggested that it may be involved in protecting the virus against the post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) system found in plants. We wanted to do a phylogenomic mapping of viral AlkB-like domains as a basis for analysing functional aspects of these domains, because this could have some relevance for understanding possible alternative roles of AlkB homologues e.g. in Eukaryotes. RESULTS: Profile-based searches of protein sequence libraries showed that AlkB-like domains are found in at least 22 different single-stranded RNA positive-strand plant viruses, but mainly in a subgroup of the Flexiviridae family. Sequence analysis indicated that the AlkB domains probably are functionally conserved, and that they most likely have been integrated relatively recently into several viral genomes at geographically distinct locations. This pattern seems to be more consistent with increased environmental pressure, e.g. from methylating pesticides, than with interaction with the PTGS system. CONCLUSIONS: The AlkB domain found in viral genomes is most likely a conventional DNA/RNA repair domain that protects the viral RNA genome against methylating compounds from the environment.",0
Allo-SCT for multiple myeloma: a review of outcomes at a single transplant center,"

This study examines the efficacy of Allo-SCT in multiple myeloma (MM) treatment at a single transplant center. From 2010–2019, outcomes of transplants for MM patients were tracked through evaluation and monitoring of short-term graft rejection, acute toxicities, long-term graft acceptance with minimal immunosuppression maintenance therapy, and overall survival rate. Furthermore, this study compares the results to other published studies involving MM patient treatments that underwent allogeneic stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT). Understanding how different types of regimes influence post-transplant outcomes is crucially important to providing optimal care for patients undergoing these procedures. The main objective was to evaluate Allo-SCT as an effective treatment for MM by measuring such outcomes over time at a single transplant center. This paper will discuss the current literature on responding therapies involved in regenerative medicine including Allo-SCT for treating multiple myeloma within a specific population studied at one transplant clinic from the last 9 years.",1
Nursing heroism in the 21(st )Century',"BACKGROUND: The Vivian Bullwinkel Oration honours the life and work of an extraordinary nurse. Given her story and that of her World War II colleagues, the topic of nursing heroism in the 21(st )century could not be more germane. DISCUSSION: Is heroism a legitimate part of nursing, or are nurses simply 'just doing their job' even when facing extreme personal danger? In this paper I explore the place and relevance of heroism in contemporary nursing. I propose that nursing heroism deserves a broader appreciation and that within the term lie many hidden, 'unsung' or 'unrecorded' heroisms. I also challenge the critiques of heroism that would condemn it as part of a 'militarisation' of nursing. Finally, I argue that nursing needs to be more open in celebrating our heroes and the transformative power of nursing achievements. SUMMARY: The language of heroism may sound quaint by 21(st )Century standards but nursing heroism is alive and well in the best of our contemporary nursing ethos and practice.",0
ELM—the database of eukaryotic linear motifs,"

This research article presents ELM—the database of eukaryotic linear motifs. ELM is a compilation of functionally relevant short protein sequences, which are the fundamental units of cellular signaling networks. This database provides detailed information about the molecular organization and interactions within known eukaryotic linear motifs, helping computational biologists to decipher complex downstream pathways encoded in regulatory proteins. The researchers demonstrate its utility by clustering experimentally validated complexes that recognize different binding sites in various species, illustrating an innovative experimental approach for identifying new regulatory partners or activators with increased accuracy. Through this work they have created a powerful tool for gaining insights into regulation at the level of linear peptide sequences and provide scientists from several fields with access to data on how these proteins interact with other pathways and molecules involved in living cells.",1
Development of an optimized RNA-based murine norovirus reverse genetics system,"Murine norovirus (MNV), identified in 2003, is the only norovirus which replicates efficiently in tissue culture and as a result has been used extensively as a model for human noroviruses, a major cause of acute gastroenteritis. The current report describes the generation of a new approach to reverse genetics recovery of genetically defined MNV that relies on the transfection of in vitro transcribed capped RNA directly into cells. The use of the recently developed ScriptCap post-transcriptional enzymatic capping system, followed by optimized Neon mediated electroporation of the highly permissive RAW 264.7 cells, resulted in the rapid and robust recovery of infectious MNV. Transfection of cells capable of supporting virus replication but not permissive to virus infection, namely human or hamster kidney cells, also resulted in robust recovery of infectious virus without subsequent amplification by multiple rounds of re-infection. This latter system may provide a reproducible method to measure the specific infectivity of mutant norovirus RNA allowing the accurate quantitation of the effect of mutations on norovirus replication.",0
"Journals, Academics, and Pandemics","In the wake of the SARS epidemic and the H1N1 pandemic, the PLoS Medicine editors ask whether journal publishing is an efficient enough mechanism for information sharing.",0
Immune pathways and defence mechanisms in honey bees Apis mellifera,"Social insects are able to mount both group-level and individual defences against pathogens. Here we focus on individual defences, by presenting a genome-wide analysis of immunity in a social insect, the honey bee Apis mellifera. We present honey bee models for each of four signalling pathways associated with immunity, identifying plausible orthologues for nearly all predicted pathway members. When compared to the sequenced Drosophila and Anopheles genomes, honey bees possess roughly one-third as many genes in 17 gene families implicated in insect immunity. We suggest that an implied reduction in immune flexibility in bees reflects either the strength of social barriers to disease, or a tendency for bees to be attacked by a limited set of highly coevolved pathogens.",0
Multiplexed Genetic Analysis Using an Expanded Genetic Alphabet,"BACKGROUND: All states require some kind of testing for newborns, but the policies are far from standardized. In some states, newborn screening may include genetic tests for a wide range of targets, but the costs and complexities of the newer genetic tests inhibit expansion of newborn screening. We describe the development and technical evaluation of a multiplex platform that may foster increased newborn genetic screening. METHODS: MultiCode(®) PLx involves three major steps: PCR, target-specific extension, and liquid chip decoding. Each step is performed in the same reaction vessel, and the test is completed in ~3 h. For site-specific labeling and room-temperature decoding, we use an additional base pair constructed from isoguanosine and isocytidine. We used the method to test for mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. The developed test was performed manually and by automated liquid handling. Initially, 225 samples with a range of genotypes were tested retrospectively with the method. A prospective study used samples from >400 newborns. RESULTS: In the retrospective study, 99.1% of samples were correctly genotyped with no incorrect calls made. In the perspective study, 95% of the samples were correctly genotyped for all targets, and there were no incorrect calls. CONCLUSIONS: The unique genetic multiplexing platform was successfully able to test for 31 targets within the CFTR gene and provides accurate genotype assignments in a clinical setting.",0
Interleukin-18 expression and the response to treatment in patients with psoriasis,"

This study focuses on the role of interleukin-18 (IL-18) expression in patients suffering from psoriasis and the effect of topical corticosteroid treatment. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition, with an increasing prevalence globally. Excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis, which can lead to local tissue damage and altered body homeostasis if left uncontrolled. IL-18 has recently been identified as playing a key role in mediating several aspects of this pro-inflammatory response; however, its exact regulatory roles remain largely unknown. We aimed to evaluate IL- 18 expression levels following effective topical steroid therapy for cutaneous psoriatic plaques and to reveals insights into its potential mechanism(s) regulating inflammation during the course of treatment. Patients with severe or moderate disease activity were selected for evaluation over 6 weeks using ELISA tests; clinical findings and biopsies before/after treatments were conducted for comparison between groups receiving different concentrations of medications. Our findings indicate that higher doses used yields better overall pustular reduction and beneficial changes in IL‑18 expression traits amongst individuals representing different patterns associated severity scales compared to lower dose counterparts.. This suggests that understanding underlying mechanisms behind regulated IL‑18 function may hold promise insight towards tackling improving patient outcomes even further through refining current standard therapeutic regimes utilized today.",1
"Chinese-like Strain of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus, Thailand","Since late 2007, several outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection have emerged in Thailand. Phylogenetic analysis places all Thai PEDV isolates during the outbreaks in the same clade as the Chinese strain JS-2004-2. This new genotype PEDV is prevailing and currently causing sporadic outbreaks in Thailand.",0
Multiplex primer prediction software for divergent targets,"We describe a Multiplex Primer Prediction (MPP) algorithm to build multiplex compatible primer sets to amplify all members of large, diverse and unalignable sets of target sequences. The MPP algorithm is scalable to larger target sets than other available software, and it does not require a multiple sequence alignment. We applied it to questions in viral detection, and demonstrated that there are no universally conserved priming sequences among viruses and that it could require an unfeasibly large number of primers (∼3700 18-mers or ∼2000 10-mers) to generate amplicons from all sequenced viruses. We then designed primer sets separately for each viral family, and for several diverse species such as foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) segments of influenza A virus, Norwalk virus, and HIV-1. We empirically demonstrated the application of the software with a multiplex set of 16 short (10 nt) primers designed to amplify the Poxviridae family to produce a specific amplicon from vaccinia virus.",0
Elevation of Intact and Proteolytic Fragments of Acute Phase Proteins Constitutes the Earliest Systemic Antiviral Response in HIV-1 Infection,"The earliest immune responses activated in acute human immunodeficiency virus type 1 infection (AHI) exert a critical influence on subsequent virus spread or containment. During this time frame, components of the innate immune system such as macrophages and DCs, NK cells, β-defensins, complement and other anti-microbial factors, which have all been implicated in modulating HIV infection, may play particularly important roles. A proteomics-based screen was performed on a cohort from whom samples were available at time points prior to the earliest positive HIV detection. The ability of selected factors found to be elevated in the plasma during AHI to inhibit HIV-1 replication was analyzed using in vitro PBMC and DC infection models. Analysis of unique plasma donor panels spanning the eclipse and viral expansion phases revealed very early alterations in plasma proteins in AHI. Induction of acute phase protein serum amyloid A (A-SAA) occurred as early as 5–7 days prior to the first detection of plasma viral RNA, considerably prior to any elevation in systemic cytokine levels. Furthermore, a proteolytic fragment of alpha–1-antitrypsin (AAT), termed virus inhibitory peptide (VIRIP), was observed in plasma coincident with viremia. Both A-SAA and VIRIP have anti-viral activity in vitro and quantitation of their plasma levels indicated that circulating concentrations are likely to be within the range of their inhibitory activity. Our results provide evidence for a first wave of host anti-viral defense occurring in the eclipse phase of AHI prior to systemic activation of other immune responses. Insights gained into the mechanism of action of acute-phase reactants and other innate molecules against HIV and how they are induced could be exploited for the future development of more efficient prophylactic vaccine strategies.",0
DotKnot: pseudoknot prediction using the probability dot plot under a refined energy model,"RNA pseudoknots are functional structure elements with key roles in viral and cellular processes. Prediction of a pseudoknotted minimum free energy structure is an NP-complete problem. Practical algorithms for RNA structure prediction including restricted classes of pseudoknots suffer from high runtime and poor accuracy for longer sequences. A heuristic approach is to search for promising pseudoknot candidates in a sequence and verify those. Afterwards, the detected pseudoknots can be further analysed using bioinformatics or laboratory techniques. We present a novel pseudoknot detection method called DotKnot that extracts stem regions from the secondary structure probability dot plot and assembles pseudoknot candidates in a constructive fashion. We evaluate pseudoknot free energies using novel parameters, which have recently become available. We show that the conventional probability dot plot makes a wide class of pseudoknots including those with bulged stems manageable in an explicit fashion. The energy parameters now become the limiting factor in pseudoknot prediction. DotKnot is an efficient method for long sequences, which finds pseudoknots with higher accuracy compared to other known prediction algorithms. DotKnot is accessible as a web server at http://dotknot.csse.uwa.edu.au.",0
"The impact of sex, gender and pregnancy on 2009 H1N1 disease","Children and young adults of reproductive age have emerged as groups that are highly vulnerable to the current 2009 H1N1 pandemic. The sex of an individual is a fundamental factor that can influence exposure, susceptibility and immune responses to influenza. Worldwide, the incidence, disease burden, morbidity and mortality rates following exposure to the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus differ between males and females and are often age-dependent. Pregnancy and differences in the presentation of various risk factors contribute to the worse outcome of infection in women. Vaccination and antiviral treatment efficacy also vary in a sex-dependent manner. Finally, sex-specific genetic and hormonal differences may contribute to the severity of influenza and the clearance of viral infection. The contribution of sex and gender to influenza can only be determined by a greater consideration of these factors in clinical and epidemiological studies and increased research into the biological basis underlying these differences.",0
Primary biliary cirrhosis,"Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an immune-mediated chronic cholestatic liver disease with a slowly progressive course. Without treatment, most patients eventually develop fibrosis and cirrhosis of the liver and may need liver transplantation in the late stage of disease. PBC primarily affects women (female preponderance 9–10:1) with a prevalence of up to 1 in 1,000 women over 40 years of age. Common symptoms of the disease are fatigue and pruritus, but most patients are asymptomatic at first presentation. The diagnosis is based on sustained elevation of serum markers of cholestasis, i.e., alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transferase, and the presence of serum antimitochondrial antibodies directed against the E2 subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. Histologically, PBC is characterized by florid bile duct lesions with damage to biliary epithelial cells, an often dense portal inflammatory infiltrate and progressive loss of small intrahepatic bile ducts. Although the insight into pathogenetic aspects of PBC has grown enormously during the recent decade and numerous genetic, environmental, and infectious factors have been disclosed which may contribute to the development of PBC, the precise pathogenesis remains enigmatic. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) is currently the only FDA-approved medical treatment for PBC. When administered at adequate doses of 13–15 mg/kg/day, up to two out of three patients with PBC may have a normal life expectancy without additional therapeutic measures. The mode of action of UDCA is still under discussion, but stimulation of impaired hepatocellular and cholangiocellular secretion, detoxification of bile, and antiapoptotic effects may represent key mechanisms. One out of three patients does not adequately respond to UDCA therapy and may need additional medical therapy and/or liver transplantation. This review summarizes current knowledge on the clinical, diagnostic, pathogenetic, and therapeutic aspects of PBC.",0
A Method to Identify p62's UBA Domain Interacting Proteins,"The UBA domain is a conserved sequence motif among polyubiquitin binding proteins. For the first time, we demonstrate a systematic, high throughput approach to identification of UBA domain-interacting proteins from a proteome-wide perspective. Using the rabbit reticulocyte lysate in vitro expression cloning system, we have successfully identified eleven proteins that interact with p62’s UBA domain, and the majority of the eleven proteins are associated with neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease. Therefore, p62 may play a novel regulatory role through its UBA domain. Our approach provides an easy route to the characterization of UBA domain interacting proteins and its application will unfold the important roles that the UBA domain plays.",0
Screening Pneumonia Patients for Mimivirus,"Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APM), a virus of free-living amebae, has reportedly caused human respiratory disease. Using 2 newly developed real-time PCR assays, we screened 496 respiratory specimens from 9 pneumonia-patient populations for APM. This virus was not detected in any specimen, which suggests it is not a common respiratory pathogen.",0
Age groups and spread of influenza: implications for vaccination strategy,"BACKGROUND: The unpredictable nature of the potentially devastating impact of 2009 pH1N1 influenza pandemic highlights the need for pandemic preparedness planning, where modeling studies could be most useful for simulations of possible future scenarios. METHODS: A compartmental model with pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic influenza infections is proposed which incorporates age groups as well as intervention measures such as age-specific vaccination, in order to study spread of influenza in a community. RESULTS: We derive the basic reproduction number and other effective reproduction numbers under various intervention measures. For illustration, we make use of the Pneumonia and Influenza (P&I) mortality data and vaccination data of the very young (age 0-2) and the very old (age >64) during 2004-2005 Taiwan winter influenza season to fit our model and to compute the relevant reproduction numbers. The reproduction number for this winter flu season is estimated to be slightly above one (~1.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Comparatively large errors in fitting the P&I mortality data of the elderly (>64) were observed shortly after winter school closings in January, which may indicate the impact of younger, more active age groups transmitting influenza to other age groups outside of the school settings; in particular, to the elderly in the households. Pre-symptomatic infections seemed to have little effect on the model fit, while asymptomatic infection by asymptomatic infectives has a more pronounced impact on the model fit for the elderly mortality, perhaps indicating a larger role in disease transmission by asymptomatic infection. Simulations indicate that the impact of vaccination on the disease incidence might not be fully revealed in the change (or the lack thereof) in the effective reproduction number with interventions, but could still be substantial. The estimated per contact transmission probability for susceptible elderly is significantly higher than that of any other age group, perhaps highlighting the vulnerability of the elderly due to close contacts with their caretakers from other age groups. The relative impact of targeting the very young and the very old for vaccination was weakened by their relative inactivity, thus giving evidence of the lack of impact of vaccinating these two groups on the overall transmissibility of the disease in the community. This further underscores the need for morbidity-based strategy to prevent elderly mortality.",0
Mutations in the Fusion Protein Cleavage Site of Avian Paramyxovirus Serotype 4 Confer Increased Replication and Syncytium Formation In Vitro but Not Increased Replication and Pathogenicity in Chickens and Ducks,"

This research paper aims to explore the effects of mutations in the fusion protein cleavage site of avian paramyxovirus serotype 4 (APMV-4) and how they influence viral replication and pathogenicity when tested both in vitro and in vivo. Avian paramyxoviruses are viruses commonly found infecting chickens, ducks, pheasants, turkeys and other birds. These infections can cause a wide range of clinical symptoms from asymptomatic infections to severe fatal diseases. Therefore, understanding how different virus strains replicate and affect host species is critical for determining possible transmission routes and ultimately improving control strategies for this group of illnesses. In this study, reverse genetics technology was employed to evaluate four G486 mutants with single amino acid substitutions within the APVM-4 fusion protein cleavage region on their replication properties both in chick embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) cultures as well as live chickens or ducklings. Our results indicate that while most mutant viruses replicated similarly to wild type virus at 28 °C when cultured with CEFs, they demonstrated significantly increased formation of syncytia along with enhanced replicative activity under these conditions but had no effect on virulence or transmission potential when tested against poultry hosts.",1
Replication-Competent Recombinant Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS) Viruses Expressing Indicator Proteins and Antiviral Cytokines,"

This paper presents a novel approach to the battle against Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), an economically significant disease of pigs. The goal is to create replication-competent recombinant PRRS viruses that express indicator proteins and antiviral cytokines in order to facilitate detection, vaccination, and precise therapeutics. To accomplish this feat, reverse genetics methods were employed with nucleic acid sequences extracted from field isolates of classical PRRS virus (PRRSV). Further selection processes led to the successful identification of three modified vaccinia Ankara vector constructs containing full-length PRRS ORF7 gene sequence flanked by signal peptide 3’UTR elements which enabled expression in pig pulmonary epithelial cells. The remaining portions of our research set out demonstrate that the resultant products meet requirements for valid incorporation into targeted cell lines as it does not compromise biological activity or cause cellular cytotoxicity throughout manipulation for further testing.",1
Avian Influenza Virus Glycoproteins Restrict Virus Replication and Spread through Human Airway Epithelium at Temperatures of the Proximal Airways,"Transmission of avian influenza viruses from bird to human is a rare event even though avian influenza viruses infect the ciliated epithelium of human airways in vitro and ex vivo. Using an in vitro model of human ciliated airway epithelium (HAE), we demonstrate that while human and avian influenza viruses efficiently infect at temperatures of the human distal airways (37°C), avian, but not human, influenza viruses are restricted for infection at the cooler temperatures of the human proximal airways (32°C). These data support the hypothesis that avian influenza viruses, ordinarily adapted to the temperature of the avian enteric tract (40°C), rarely infect humans, in part due to differences in host airway regional temperatures. Previously, a critical residue at position 627 in the avian influenza virus polymerase subunit, PB2, was identified as conferring temperature-dependency in mammalian cells. Here, we use reverse genetics to show that avianization of residue 627 attenuates a human virus, but does not account for the different infection between 32°C and 37°C. To determine the mechanism of temperature restriction of avian influenza viruses in HAE at 32°C, we generated recombinant human influenza viruses in either the A/Victoria/3/75 (H3N2) or A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) genetic background that contained avian or avian-like glycoproteins. Two of these viruses, A/Victoria/3/75 with L226Q and S228G mutations in hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99 and A/PR/8/34 containing the H7 and N1 from A/Chick/Italy/1347/99, exhibited temperature restriction approaching that of wholly avian influenza viruses. These data suggest that influenza viruses bearing avian or avian-like surface glycoproteins have a reduced capacity to establish productive infection at the temperature of the human proximal airways. This temperature restriction may limit zoonotic transmission of avian influenza viruses and suggests that adaptation of avian influenza viruses to efficient infection at 32°C may represent a critical evolutionary step enabling human-to-human transmission.",0
mRNA pseudoknot structures can act as ribosomal roadblocks,"

The title of this study is ‘mRNA Pseudoknot Structures Can Act as Ribosomal Roadblocks’. mRNA pseudoknot structures are common in eukaryotic cells, often modulating the translation phase by hindering protein synthesis with their unique three-dimensional structure. This complex phenomenon has remained largely unexplored in terms of its wider implications for cellular function and development biology. Our research seeks to understand how these pseudoknots may interact with ribosomes - a fundamental component of the cell responsible for protein synthesis - to present an obstacle that interferes with normal translational outcomes. We sought to identify particular motifs from different mRNAs that could potentially act as road blocks in ribosome scanning activities or cause errors during overall protein production. To test our hypothesis we used extensively the bioinformatic tools developed at our lab combined with surface plasmon resonance imaging experiments directly conducted on purified proteins samples banked within research databases around Europe. The results obtained indicate that interesting features are present when introducing pseudoknot structures inside RNA templates which can offer evidence confirming our hypothesis and support additional studies into this still uncharted field",1

Noninvasive positive pressure ventilation for acute respiratory failure in children: a concise review,"

This paper reviews the use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NPPV) in children with acute respiratory failure. It evaluates evidence on aspects concerning its effectiveness, effect on mortality and morbidity, patient comfort, potential adverse effects and additional complications. The introduction provides an overview of what NPPV is and why it has become an increasingly popular treatment in pediatrics since its first approval by the U.S Food & Drug Administration for adults in 2001. Research studies demonstrate that NPPV leads to improved oxygenation levels as well as reduced discomfort for patients compared to other methods such as endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. Additionally, clinical trials have shown reductions in length of hospital stay along with lower mortality rates when used with adjuncts like bilevel positive airway pressure systems. Discussion includes key pharmacologic protocols associated with pediatric cases including considerations taken into account during medical decision-making processes determining severity among practitioners both pre-hospitalized or hospitalized settings due to congenital anomalies or critical illness progression; highlighting necessary precautions regarding setting selection appropriately prior to repetitive initiation session relative to personal safety measures for healthcare workers providing NPPV services within ventilated suites manifesting under continuous monitoring regime throughout each interval dependent encounter process(es).

Human Subtilase SKI-1/S1P Is a Master Regulator of the HCV Lifecycle and a Potential Host Cell Target for Developing Indirect-Acting Antiviral Agents,"

The Human subtilase SKI-1/S1P has long been recognized as an essential part of the cellular energy generation process. More recently, however, it has been discovered to be a master regulator of the Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) lifecycle and potentially a promising target for developing novel indirect-acting antiviral agents. The objective of this research was to investigate the effects of manipulating human SKI-1/S1P expression levels on HCV replication in order to gain further insight into its function in the host cell environment. In particular, we demonstrate that increasing S1P expression levels significantly reduced viral production from cells infected with both wild type and mutant forms of HCV genotype 2a. Moreover, these findings suggest a potential role for S1P in regulating innate immunity pathways associated with HCV infection and provide an open avenue for exploring selectively targeted anti-viral therapies based on modulation of human subtilase SKI- 1/SIP activity.",1
Early Clinical Features of Dengue Virus Infection in Nicaraguan Children: A Longitudinal Analysis,"

This study examines the early clinical features of dengue virus infection in Nicaraguan children and investigates how these symptoms differ from other febrile illnesses. Using a longitudinal analysis, this paper looks at the frequency and severity of several specific signs and symptoms associated with acute dengue virus infection in a sample population over two years. Through detailed observation, systemic reviews, interviews and analyses, this study elucidates which indicators are most common to the disease, as well as offering insights into demographic details that might predict illness-severitysuch as age or gender. Moreover there is an exploration of socioenvironmental factors influencing transmission dynamics amongst Nicaraguan pediatric populations – such as housing density or natural breeding habitats for Aedes mosquitos. Aside from scientific investigation of important risk groups and effective interventions to prevent ongoing transmission; knowledge gathered on initial presenting signs can help enhance diagnosis accuracy in timely fashion so individuals may access treatment that could improve their prognosis while also allowing primary health care providers to identify when progressive medical management ore referral becomes necessary before symptom complexity increases significantly.

HIV-Specific T-Cells Accumulate in the Liver in HCV/HIV Co-Infection,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Hepatitis C Virus (HCV)-related liver disease progresses more rapidly in individuals co-infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV), although the underlying immunologic mechanisms are unknown. We examined whether HIV-specific T-cells are identified in the liver of HCV/HIV co-infected individuals and promote liver inflammation through bystander immune responses. METHODS: Ex-vivo intra-hepatic lymphocytes from HCV mono-infected and HCV/HIV co-infected individuals were assessed for immune responses to HIV and HCV antigens by polychromatic flow cytometry. RESULTS: HCV/HIV liver biopsies had similar frequencies of lymphocytes but lower percentages of CD4(+) T-cells compared to HCV biopsies. In co-infection, intra-hepatic HIV-specific CD8(+) and CD4(+) T-cells producing IFN-γ and TNF-α were detected and were comparable in frequency to those that were HCV-specific. In co-infected individuals, viral-specific CD8(+) T-cells produced more of the fibrogenic cytokine, TNF-α. In both mono- and co-infected individuals, intra-hepatic HCV-specific T-cells were poorly functional compared to HIV-specific T-cells. In co-infection, HAART was not associated with a reconstitution of intra-hepatic CD4(+) T-cells and was associated with reduction in both HIV and HCV-specific intra-hepatic cytokine responses. CONCLUSION: The accumulation of functional HIV-specific T-cells in the liver during HCV/HIV co-infection may represent a bystander role for HIV in inducing faster progression of liver disease.",0
Quantifying Type-Specific Reproduction Numbers for Nosocomial Pathogens: Evidence for Heightened Transmission of an Asian Sequence Type 239 MRSA Clone,"

This paper presents a novel approach to quantify type-specific reproduction numbers for nosocomial pathogens, specifically relating to the heightened transmission of an Asian sequence-type 239 MRSA clone. Through meticulous analysis of multiple epidemic case studies in several healthcare settings during a 4 year period, we have shown that our proposed approach is reliable and informative with respect to describing the epidemiology of bacterial infections. In particular, using real data from detailed molecular typing manual investigations, we were able to obtain an estimate of the reproduction number at both strain and genotype level which together provided insight into clustering patterns related to potential superinfections occurring from patients sharing neighboring beds or rooms over long periods of time. Furthermore, this quantitative evidence confirmed previous findings suggesting a trend towards increased transmission rates specific for this Asian clone when compared with other known endemic clones associated with hospitals worldwide. Our results greatly enhance our understanding around pathogen transmission within hospital environments helping scientists address future outbreaks more effectively by providing estimates about how quickly new cases arise and spread in different contexts as well as aiding public health professions confirm multi drug resistance infection spreads among populations on global scales.",1
Distribution and Risk Factors of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) in Mainland China,"

This study examines the distribution and risk factors of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in mainland China. We conducted a retrospective case series based on reported domestic cases from late 2009 to mid-2010, along with ancillary data sources. We assessed regional differences by gross region and subregions, examined epidemiological patterns and associated variables including socioeconomic factors, climate characteristics among regions using discrete geographical information system (GIS) analysis methods. Results indicated surface temperature had significant associations to incidence rate ratio of H1N1 infection at the subregion level while no associations were found between precipitation or humidity rates with cumulative incidence rate ratios. Our study serves as an important reminder that measures need to be taken when temperatures change affects causes a high percentage cases even within regionally uniformed areas for successful management of infectious diseases such as pandemics.

ColorPhylo: A Color Code to Accurately Display Taxonomic Classifications,"

This paper presents ColorPhylo, a novel method to conceptually and graphically illustrate taxonomic ranks through colors. The multi-level system is composed of nine distinctive levels which can be represented with their assigned colors that cover the axis from warm colors up to cold colors for hierarchical representing the different orders and classes. With its main focus on color perception in contrast to rank labeling, ColorPhylo precisely visualizes phylogenetic classifications within biological complex systems and adds an attractive aesthetic character in communication processes between operating agents. Validations have been done over different controlled data sets of organisms obtained from official scientific sources and it demonstrates an overall success rate above 70%. These results highlight ColorPhylo as a successful tool capable of accurately displaying the scientific relationships among all species at hand - across multiple domains - making easier than ever before many studies related to ecosystems' interactions or medicinal applications, just two simple examples mentioned herein out of many other possibilities available.",1
Activation of the Cellular Unfolded Protein Response by Recombinant Adeno-Associated Virus Vectors," 

This study provides an important insight into the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) by recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) vectors. It is well known that rAAV has great potential for gene therapy, and its use for in vitro studies requires an understanding of how it affects cellular UPR pathways. Through a series of experiments, this paper illuminates the effect that rAAV vectors may have on activating cellular stress responses. The results suggest that when properly administered and replicated within cell lines, such as HeLa cells or primary human fibroblasts, these vectors significantly activate UPR mediated by inositol requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α). Upon further investigation at later points in time after vector transfection, both canonical IRE1α activities and downstream signaling cascades were observed to be activated suggesting sustained engagement with the UPR pathway. This data builds upon previous literature looking at the impacts of AAVmediated expression systems on normal cell physiology but more specifically extends our understanding regarding their effects on UPR pathways under varying conditions. Given its importance for therapeutic applications involving gene delivery using AAVbased approaches this work will prove valuable as researchers attempt to finely tune them to achieve optimal safety profiles while maximizing efficacy potentials.",1
HIV Antigen Incorporation within Adenovirus Hexon Hypervariable 2 for a Novel HIV Vaccine Approach,"Adenoviral (Ad) vectors have been used for a variety of vaccine applications including cancer and infectious diseases. Traditionally, Ad-based vaccines are designed to express antigens through transgene expression of a given antigen. However, in some cases these conventional Ad-based vaccines have had sub-optimal clinical results. These sub-optimal results are attributed in part to pre-existing Ad serotype 5 (Ad5) immunity. In order to circumvent the need for antigen expression via transgene incorporation, the “antigen capsid-incorporation” strategy has been developed and used for Ad-based vaccine development in the context of a few diseases. This strategy embodies the incorporation of antigenic peptides within the capsid structure of viral vectors. The major capsid protein hexon has been utilized for these capsid incorporation strategies due to hexon's natural role in the generation of anti-Ad immune response and its numerical representation within the Ad virion. Using this strategy, we have developed the means to incorporate heterologous peptide epitopes specifically within the major surface-exposed domains of the Ad capsid protein hexon. Our study herein focuses on generation of multivalent vaccine vectors presenting HIV antigens within the Ad capsid protein hexon, as well as expressing an HIV antigen as a transgene. These novel vectors utilize HVR2 as an incorporation site for a twenty-four amino acid region of the HIV membrane proximal ectodomain region (MPER), derived from HIV glycoprotein gp41 (gp41). Our study herein illustrates that our multivalent anti-HIV vectors elicit a cellular anti-HIV response. Furthermore, vaccinations with these vectors, which present HIV antigens at HVR2, elicit a HIV epitope-specific humoral immune response.",0
H5N1 and 1918 Pandemic Influenza Virus Infection Results in Early and Excessive Infiltration of Macrophages and Neutrophils in the Lungs of Mice,"Fatal human respiratory disease associated with the 1918 pandemic influenza virus and potentially pandemic H5N1 viruses is characterized by severe lung pathology, including pulmonary edema and extensive inflammatory infiltrate. Here, we quantified the cellular immune response to infection in the mouse lung by flow cytometry and demonstrate that mice infected with highly pathogenic (HP) H1N1 and H5N1 influenza viruses exhibit significantly high numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in the lungs compared to mice infected with low pathogenic (LP) viruses. Mice infected with the 1918 pandemic virus and a recent H5N1 human isolate show considerable similarities in overall lung cellularity, lung immune cell sub-population composition and cellular immune temporal dynamics. Interestingly, while these similarities were observed, the HP H5N1 virus consistently elicited significantly higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in whole lungs and primary human macrophages, revealing a potentially critical difference in the pathogenesis of H5N1 infections. These results together show that infection with HP influenza viruses such as H5N1 and the 1918 pandemic virus leads to a rapid cell recruitment of macrophages and neutrophils into the lungs, suggesting that these cells play a role in acute lung inflammation associated with HP influenza virus infection. In addition, primary macrophages and dendritic cells were also susceptible to 1918 and H5N1 influenza virus infection in vitro and in infected mouse lung tissue.",0
Regulation of the apoptosis-inducing kinase DRAK2 by cyclooxygenase-2 in colorectal cancer,"BACKGROUND: Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is over-expressed in colorectal cancer (CRC), rendering tumour cells resistant to apoptosis. Selective COX-2 inhibition is effective in CRC prevention, although having adverse cardiovascular effects, thus focus has shifted to downstream pathways. METHODS: Microarray experiments identified genes regulated by COX-2 in HCA7 CRC cells. In vitro and in vivo regulation of DRAK2 (DAP kinase-related apoptosis-inducing kinase 2 or STK17β, an apoptosis-inducing kinase) by COX-2 was validated by qRT-PCR. RESULTS: Inhibition of COX-2 induced apoptosis and enhanced DRAK2 expression in HCA7 cells (4.4-fold increase at 4 h by qRT-PCR, P=0.001), an effect prevented by co-administration of PGE(2). DRAK2 levels were suppressed in a panel of human colorectal tumours (n=10) compared to normal mucosa, and showed inverse correlation with COX-2 expression (R=−0.68, R(2)=0.46, P=0.03). Administration of the selective COX-2 inhibitor rofecoxib to patients with CRC (n=5) induced DRAK2 expression in tumours (2.5-fold increase, P=0.01). In vitro silencing of DRAK2 by RNAi enhanced CRC cell survival following COX-2 inhibitor treatment. CONCLUSION: DRAK2 is a serine–threonine kinase implicated in the regulation of apoptosis and is negatively regulated by COX-2 in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a novel mechanism for the effect of COX-2 on cancer cell survival.",0
Influenza A H1N1 2009 (Swine Flu) and Pregnancy,"

In recent years, Influenza A H1N1 2009 (Swine Flu) has emerged as a major health concern in both pregnant and non-pregnant alike. This article focuses on the impact of Swine Flu on pregnant women worldwide, evaluating how it affects maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality outcomes. Studies regarding the epidemiology of pregnancies affected by H1N1 are reviewed to provide an overall picture of this virus's effect on gestational health. Furthermore, specific interventions aimed at managing Swine Flu among expectant mothers are discussed with emphasis placed on immunization strategies as well as beneficial medications used to treat symptoms associated with infection. The aim is to present possible solutions for prevention as well as mitigation of adverse effects due to Influenza A H1N1 2009 that may occur in pregnancy. Ultimately, this study provides evidence for healthcare professionals concerning potential medical intervention methods which may help reduce mortality or severe morbidity during gestation due to influenza outbreaks within the current global pandemic context.",1
The Immunosuppressive Agent Mizoribine Monophosphate Is an Inhibitor of the Human RNA Capping Enzyme,"

The potential of mizoribine monophosphate (MMP) as an immunosuppressive agent has long been studied in the scientific domain. As an essential step of mRNA synthesis and capping in eukaryotes, RNA capping is a process whereby guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) is enzymatically converted to form either 7-methylguanosine or 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap. Recent evidence strongly suggests that MMP may act as inhibitor of human RNA capping enzyme. To evaluate whether this hypothesis true, we conducted studies on the effect of mm on wild type hCEP128 cell line and evaluated its impact on Ribonuclease T1 assays using RT-qPCR. Results from our study showed strong evidence for MMP to be considered a potent inhibitor of the human RNA Capping enzyme with significant results noted throughout all experiments carried out. In conclusion, our research demonstrated within reasonable certainty that MMP can inhibit major function mediated by the human nucleus encased protein 128 gene product related to or controlling gene expression downstream effects such as replication and transcription leading to potential strategy for term use in pharmacological development as prevent activator agents in certain pathologies associated with inappropriate down regulation or upregulation caused by nuclear protein malfunction processes signaling pathways at cellular level which lead to cancer formation.

Baculovirus-based Vaccine Displaying Respiratory Syncytial Virus Glycoprotein Induces Protective Immunity against RSV Infection without Vaccine-Enhanced Disease,"

This research paper presents a study that analyzed the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of a novel vaccine against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. The vaccine is composed of an outer protein shell produced by recombinant baculoviruses and displays RSV glycoprotein on its surface. By administering this novel vaccine to mice susceptible to RSV disease, the authors were able to establish that it successfully induced protective immunity against subsequent challenge with virulent RSV without causing any detrimental side effects or exacerbate symptoms such as inflammation through enhanced infection caused by the vaccine itself - an occurrence commonly reported in past studies related to vaccines involving live attenuated viruses. Thus, these findings provide evidence for further development of this type of baculovirus-based platform technology as an innovative solution for effective vaccination strategies against serious human infectious diseases like RSV.

Human Pregnancy Specific Beta-1-Glycoprotein 1 (PSG1) Has a Potential Role in Placental Vascular Morphogenesis,"Previous studies suggest that human pregnancy specific beta-1-glycoproteins (PSGs) play immunomodulatory roles during pregnancy; however, other possible functions of PSGs have yet to be explored. We have observed that PSGs induce transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1), which among its other diverse functions inhibits T-cell function and has proangiogenic properties. The present study investigates a potential role for PSG1, the most abundant PSG in maternal serum, as a possible inducer of proangiogenic growth factors known to play an important role in establishment of the vasculature at the maternal-fetal interface. To this end, we measured TGFB1, vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) A and C, and placental growth factor (PGF) protein levels in several cell types after PSG1 treatment. In addition, tube formation and wound healing assays were performed to investigate a possible direct interaction between PSG1 and endothelial cells. PSG1 induced up-regulation of both TGFB1 and VEGFA in human monocytes, macrophages, and two human extravillous trophoblast cell lines. We did not observe induction of VEGFC or PGF by PSG1 in any of the cells tested. PSG1 treatment resulted in endothelial tube formation in the presence and absence of VEGFA. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to map the essential regions within the N-domain of PSG1 required for functional activity. We found that the aspartic acid at position 95, previously believed to be required for binding of PSGs to cells, is not required for PSG1 activity but that the amino acids implicated in the formation of a salt bridge within the N-domain are essential for PSG1 function.",0
Role of Host Immune Response and Viral Load in the Differential Outcome of Pandemic H1N1 (2009) Influenza Virus Infection in Indian Patients,"BACKGROUND: An unusually high number of severe pneumonia cases with considerable mortality is being observed with the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus infections globally. In India, all mild as well as critically ill cases were admitted and treated in the government hospitals during the initial phase of the pandemic. The present study was undertaken during this early phase of the pandemic. METHODOLOGY: The role of viral load and host factors in the pathogenesis were assessed by examining 26 mild (MP), 15 critically ill patients (CIP) and 20 healthy controls from Pune, India. Sequential blood and lung aspirate samples were collected from CIP. Viral load and cytokines/chemokine levels were determined from the plasma and lung aspirates of the patients. TLR levels were determined by staining and FACS analysis. Gene profiling was done for both cells in the lung aspirates and PBMCs using TaqMan Low Density arrays. Antibody titres and isotyping was done using HA protein based ELISAs. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 13/15 critically ill patients expired. All plasma samples were negative for the virus irrespective of the patient's category. Sequential lung samples from CIP showed lower viral loads questioning association of viral replication with the severity. Anti-rpH1N1-09-HA-IgG titres were significantly higher in critically ill patients and both categories circulated exclusively IgG1 isotype. Critically ill patients exhibited increase in TLR-3, 4, 7 and decrease in TLR-2 expressions. The disease severity correlated with increased plasma levels of IL1RA, IL2, IL6, CCL3, CCL4 and IL10. Majority of the immune-function genes were down-regulated in the PBMCs and up-regulated in the cells from lung aspirates of critically ill patients. No distinct pattern differentiating fatal and surviving patients was observed when sequential samples were examined for various parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Disease severity was associated with pronounced impairment of host immune response.",0
The Waiting Time for Inter-Country Spread of Pandemic Influenza,"BACKGROUND: The time delay between the start of an influenza pandemic and its subsequent initiation in other countries is highly relevant to preparedness planning. We quantify the distribution of this random time in terms of the separate components of this delay, and assess how the delay may be extended by non-pharmaceutical interventions. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The model constructed for this time delay accounts for: (i) epidemic growth in the source region, (ii) the delay until an infected individual from the source region seeks to travel to an at-risk country, (iii) the chance that infected travelers are detected by screening at exit and entry borders, (iv) the possibility of in-flight transmission, (v) the chance that an infected arrival might not initiate an epidemic, and (vi) the delay until infection in the at-risk country gathers momentum. Efforts that reduce the disease reproduction number in the source region below two and severe travel restrictions are most effective for delaying a local epidemic, and under favourable circumstances, could add several months to the delay. On the other hand, the model predicts that border screening for symptomatic infection, wearing a protective mask during travel, promoting early presentation of cases arising among arriving passengers and moderate reduction in travel volumes increase the delay only by a matter of days or weeks. Elevated in-flight transmission reduces the delay only minimally. CONCLUSIONS: The delay until an epidemic of pandemic strain influenza is imported into an at-risk country is largely determined by the course of the epidemic in the source region and the number of travelers attempting to enter the at-risk country, and is little affected by non-pharmaceutical interventions targeting these travelers. Short of preventing international travel altogether, eradicating a nascent pandemic in the source region appears to be the only reliable method of preventing country-to-country spread of a pandemic strain of influenza.",0
Host Gene Expression Profiling of Dengue Virus Infection in Cell Lines and Patients,"BACKGROUND: Despite the seriousness of dengue-related disease, with an estimated 50–100 million cases of dengue fever and 250,000–500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome each year, a clear understanding of dengue pathogenesis remains elusive. Because of the lack of a disease model in animals and the complex immune interaction in dengue infection, the study of host response and immunopathogenesis is difficult. The development of genomics technology, microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR have allowed researchers to study gene expression changes on a much broader scale. We therefore used this approach to investigate the host response in dengue virus-infected cell lines and in patients developing dengue fever. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using microarray and high throughput quantitative PCR method to monitor the host response to dengue viral replication in cell line infection models and in dengue patient blood samples, we identified differentially expressed genes along three major pathways; NF-κB initiated immune responses, type I interferon (IFN) and the ubiquitin proteasome pathway. Among the most highly upregulated genes were the chemokines IP-10 and I-TAC, both ligands of the CXCR3 receptor. Increased expression of IP-10 and I-TAC in the peripheral blood of ten patients at the early onset of fever was confirmed by ELISA. A highly upregulated gene in the IFN pathway, viperin, was overexpressed in A549 cells resulting in a significant reduction in viral replication. The upregulation of genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway prompted the testing of proteasome inhibitors MG-132 and ALLN, both of which reduced viral replication. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Unbiased gene expression analysis has identified new host genes associated with dengue infection, which we have validated in functional studies. We showed that some parts of the host response can be used as potential biomarkers for the disease while others can be used to control dengue viral replication, thus representing viable targets for drug therapy.",0

From social data mining to forecasting socio-economic crises,"

This paper aims to explore a novel approach for predicting socio-economic crises through the use of social data mining. It presents a detailed overview of the topic, argues in favour of this method and provides proof that employing predictive analytics and machine learning on various sources of digital capture can be used to identify patterns foreshadowing economic disruption. We evaluate current technological capabilities and propose an array of targeted strategies that may be employed by public sector entities seeking to forecast economic crisis events in the near future. By leveraging advances in both artificial intelligence and big data, our research shows tangible promise towards being able to accurately anticipate major shockwaves before they happen.",1
"Pneumonia Incidence and Mortality in Mainland China: Systematic Review of Chinese and English Literature, 1985–2008","BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is a leading infectious disease killer worldwide, yet the burden in China is not well understood as much of the data is published in the non-English literature. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We systematically reviewed the Chinese- and English-language literature for studies with primary data on pneumonia incidence and mortality in mainland China. Between 1985 and 2008, 37 studies met the inclusion criteria. The quality of the studies was highly variable. For children <5 years, incidence ranged from 0.06–0.27 episodes per person-year and mortality ranged from 184–1,223 deaths per 100,000 population. Overall incidence and mortality were stable or decreased over the study period and were higher in rural compared to urban areas. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Pneumonia continues to be a major public health challenge in young children in China, and estimates of pneumonia incidence and mortality vary widely. Reliable surveillance data and new prevention efforts may be needed to achieve and document additional declines, especially in areas with higher incidence and mortality such as rural settings.",0
Prediction of RNA Pseudoknots Using Heuristic Modeling with Mapping and Sequential Folding,"Predicting RNA secondary structure is often the first step to determining the structure of RNA. Prediction approaches have historically avoided searching for pseudoknots because of the extreme combinatorial and time complexity of the problem. Yet neglecting pseudoknots limits the utility of such approaches. Here, an algorithm utilizing structure mapping and thermodynamics is introduced for RNA pseudoknot prediction that finds the minimum free energy and identifies information about the flexibility of the RNA. The heuristic approach takes advantage of the 5′ to 3′ folding direction of many biological RNA molecules and is consistent with the hierarchical folding hypothesis and the contact order model. Mapping methods are used to build and analyze the folded structure for pseudoknots and to add important 3D structural considerations. The program can predict some well known pseudoknot structures correctly. The results of this study suggest that many functional RNA sequences are optimized for proper folding. They also suggest directions we can proceed in the future to achieve even better results.",0
Species-specific evolution of immune receptor tyrosine based activation motif-containing CEACAM1-related immune receptors in the dog,"BACKGROUND: Although the impact of pathogens on the evolution of the mammalian immune system is still under debate, proteins, which both regulate immune responses and serve as cellular receptors for pathogens should be at the forefront of pathogen-driven host evolution. The CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) gene family codes for such proteins and indeed shows tremendous species-specific variation between human and rodents. Since little is known about the CEA gene family in other lineages of placental mammals, we expected to gain new insights into the evolution of the rapidly diverging CEA family by analyzing the CEA family of the dog. RESULTS: Here we describe the complete CEA gene family in the dog. We found that the gene coding for the ITIM-bearing immunoregulatory molecule CEACAM1 gave rise to a recent expansion of the canine CEA gene family by gene duplication, similar to that previously found in humans and mice. However, while the murine and human CEACAMs (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules) are predominantly secreted and GPI-anchored, respectively, in the dog, most of the CEACAMs represent ITAM-bearing transmembrane proteins. One of these proteins, CEACAM28, exhibits nearly complete sequence identity with the ligand-binding N domain of CEACAM1, but antagonizing signaling motifs in the cytoplasmic tail. Comparison of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions indicates that the CEACAM28 N domain is under the strongest purifying selection of all canine CEACAM1-related CEACAMs. In addition, CEACAM28 shows a similar expression pattern in resting immune cells and tissues as CEACAM1. However, upon activation CEACAM28 mRNA and CEACAM1 mRNA are differentially regulated. CONCLUSION: Thus, CEACAM1 and CEACAM28 are the first paired immune receptors identified within the CEA gene family, which are expressed on T cells and are most likely involved in the fine-tuning of T cell responses. The direction of gene conversion accompanied by purifying selection and expression in immune cells suggests the possibility that CEACAM28 evolved in response to selective pressure imposed by species-specific pathogens.",0
A Systematic Molecular Pathology Study of a Laboratory Confirmed H5N1 Human Case,"Autopsy studies have shown that human highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) can infect multiple human organs other than just the lungs, and that possible causes of organ damage are either viral replication and/or dysregulation of cytokines and chemokines. Uncertainty still exists, partly because of the limited number of cases analysed. In this study, a full autopsy including 5 organ systems was conducted on a confirmed H5N1 human fatal case (male, 42 years old) within 18 hours of death. In addition to the respiratory system (lungs, bronchus and trachea), virus was isolated from cerebral cortex, cerebral medullary substance, cerebellum, brain stem, hippocampus ileum, colon, rectum, ureter, aortopulmonary vessel and lymph-node. Real time RT-PCR evidence showed that matrix and hemagglutinin genes were positive in liver and spleen in addition to positive tissues with virus isolation. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization stains showed accordant evidence of viral infection with real time RT-PCR except bronchus. Quantitative RT-PCR suggested that a high viral load was associated with increased host responses, though the viral load was significantly different in various organs. Cells of the immunologic system could also be a target for virus infection. Overall, the pathogenesis of HPAI H5N1 virus was associated both with virus replication and with immunopathologic lesions. In addition, immune cells cannot be excluded from playing a role in dissemination of the virus in vivo.",0
Usefulness of Published PCR Primers in Detecting Human Rhinovirus Infection,"

This article explores the utility of PCR primers in identifying human rhinovirus infection. Current research shows that although consistently accurate, these molecular methods can be costly and require sophisticated equipment.

PhEVER: a database for the global exploration of virus–host evolutionary relationships,"Fast viral adaptation and the implication of this rapid evolution in the emergence of several new infectious diseases have turned this issue into a major challenge for various research domains. Indeed, viruses are involved in the development of a wide range of pathologies and understanding how viruses and host cells interact in the context of adaptation remains an open question. In order to provide insights into the complex interactions between viruses and their host organisms and namely in the acquisition of novel functions through exchanges of genetic material, we developed the PhEVER database. This database aims at providing accurate evolutionary and phylogenetic information to analyse the nature of virus–virus and virus–host lateral gene transfers. PhEVER (http://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/databases/phever) is a unique database of homologous families both (i) between sequences from different viruses and (ii) between viral sequences and sequences from cellular organisms. PhEVER integrates extensive data from up-to-date completely sequenced genomes (2426 non-redundant viral genomes, 1007 non-redundant prokaryotic genomes, 43 eukaryotic genomes ranging from plants to vertebrates) and offers a clustering of proteins into homologous families containing at least one viral sequences, as well as alignments and phylogenies for each of these families. Public access to PhEVER is available through its webpage and through all dedicated ACNUC retrieval systems.",0
The Nature of Protein Domain Evolution: Shaping the Interaction Network,"The proteomes that make up the collection of proteins in contemporary organisms evolved through recombination and duplication of a limited set of domains. These protein domains are essentially the main components of globular proteins and are the most principal level at which protein function and protein interactions can be understood. An important aspect of domain evolution is their atomic structure and biochemical function, which are both specified by the information in the amino acid sequence. Changes in this information may bring about new folds, functions and protein architectures. With the present and still increasing wealth of sequences and annotation data brought about by genomics, new evolutionary relationships are constantly being revealed, unknown structures modeled and phylogenies inferred. Such investigations not only help predict the function of newly discovered proteins, but also assist in mapping unforeseen pathways of evolution and reveal crucial, co-evolving inter- and intra-molecular interactions. In turn this will help us describe how protein domains shaped cellular interaction networks and the dynamics with which they are regulated in the cell. Additionally, these studies can be used for the design of new and optimized protein domains for therapy. In this review, we aim to describe the basic concepts of protein domain evolution and illustrate recent developments in molecular evolution that have provided valuable new insights in the field of comparative genomics and protein interaction networks.",0
Selective redox regulation of cytokine receptor signaling by extracellular thioredoxin-1,"The thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase thioredoxin-1 (Trx1) is known to be secreted by leukocytes and to exhibit cytokine-like properties. Extracellular effects of Trx1 require a functional active site, suggesting a redox-based mechanism of action. However, specific cell surface proteins and pathways coupling extracellular Trx1 redox activity to cellular responses have not been identified so far. Using a mechanism-based kinetic trapping technique to identify disulfide exchange interactions on the intact surface of living lymphocytes, we found that Trx1 catalytically interacts with a single principal target protein. This target protein was identified as the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 8 (TNFRSF8/CD30). We demonstrate that the redox interaction is highly specific for both Trx1 and CD30 and that the redox state of CD30 determines its ability to engage the cognate ligand and transduce signals. Furthermore, we confirm that Trx1 affects CD30-dependent changes in lymphocyte effector function. Thus, we conclude that receptor–ligand signaling interactions can be selectively regulated by an extracellular redox catalyst.",0
Synthesis of a-secomethylenamino- and substituted amidoximotriterpenoids,"

This paper presents the successful synthesis of novel a-secomethylenamino- and substituted amidoximotriterpenoids by leveraging on homogenous catalysis. Our research provides a strategy to generate chemotherapeutic agents featuring improved solubility, potency and stability. We aim to demonstrate through our study that this method allows for precise control over chemical transformations and can assist in the design of new bioactive molecules.",1
Efficient replication of pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) in a mouse macrophage cell line,"Pneumonia virus of mice (PVM; family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily Pneumovirinae) is a natural respiratory pathogen of rodent species and an important new model for the study of severe viral bronchiolitis and pneumonia. However, despite high virus titers typically detected in infected mouse lung tissue in vivo, cell lines used routinely for virus propagation in vitro are not highly susceptible to PVM infection. We have evaluated several rodent and primate cell lines for susceptibility to PVM infection, and detected highest virus titers from infection of the mouse monocyte-macrophage RAW 264.7 cell line. Additionally, virus replication in RAW 264.7 cells induces the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines relevant to respiratory virus disease, including tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interferon-β (IFN-β), macrophage inflammatory proteins 1α and 1β (MIP-1α and MIP-1β) and the functional homolog of human IL-8, mouse macrophage inflammatory peptide-2 (MIP-2). Identification and characterization of a rodent cell line that supports the replication of PVM and induces the synthesis of disease-related proinflammatory mediators will facilitate studies of molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis that will complement and expand on findings from mouse model systems.",0
Binding of Herpes Simplex Virus Type-1 Virions Leads to the Induction of Intracellular Signalling in the Absence of Virus Entry,"The envelope of HSV-1 contains a number of glycoproteins, four of which are essential for virus entry. Virus particles lacking gB, gD, gH or gL are entry-defective, although these viruses retain the ability to bind to the plasma membrane via the remaining glycoproteins. Soluble forms of gD have been shown to trigger the nuclear translocation of the NF-κB transcriptional complex in addition to stimulating the production of Type I interferon. By taking advantage of the entry-defective phenotype of glycoprotein-deficient HSV-1 virus particles, the results presented here show that binding of virions to cellular receptors on the plasma membrane is sufficient to stimulate a change in cellular gene expression. Preliminary microarray studies, validated by quantitative real-time PCR, identified the differential expression of cellular genes associated with the NF-κB, PI3K/Akt, Jak/Stat and related Jak/Src pathways by virions lacking gB or gH but not gD. Gene induction occurred at a few particles per cell, corresponding to physiological conditions during primary infection. Reporter assay studies determined that NF-κB transcriptional activity is stimulated within an hour of HSV-1 binding, peaks between two and three hours post-binding and declines to background levels by five hours after induction. The immediate, transient nature of these signalling events suggests that HSV-1 glycoproteins, particularly gD, may alter the cellular environment pre-entry so as to condition the cell for viral replication.",0
Transmission Dynamics of an SIS Model with Age Structure on Heterogeneous Networks,"

This paper focuses on the transmission dynamics of an SIS (susceptible-infected-susceptible) model in heterogeneous networks, taking into account its age structure. From a general perspective, it has been seen that there are serious errors when modeling the early stages of uniform epidemic diffusion and spread on these types of networks. In this research effort, we analyze the emergence and progression of such effects for different scenarios making use of an agent-based approach. It takes into consideration epidemiological interactions within given classes as well as changes in mixing patterns in order to examine how seasonality or vaccination programs would effectively contribute to disease control operations. Through mathematical analysis generated by our numerical simulations, models proved able to capture nonlinear distributions and complex network properties under various conditions; thus shedding light on some key problems related to vectorism phenomenon found in infectious diseases elimination strategies often overlooked due to the constraints imposed by traditional tabulated methods.",1
Mitochondrial mutations restricting spontaneous translational frameshift suppression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae,"

This study examines the impact of mitochondrial mutations on spontaneous translation frameshift suppression in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. With a focus on emerging evidence that mitochondrial dysfunction can disturb nuclear-encoded genes, our research aims to identify potential mechanisms linking these changes and their consequences for key cellular processes controlled by translational accuracy. Using genetic analysis and a series of dedicated assays, we investigate whether genetic manipulation of mtDNA-producing factors can exert selective pressure against mutations disrupting translational fidelity. The results have implications for understanding how defects at this level may lead to further diseases associated with human gene expression dysregulation. We anticipate that addressing these fundamental questions will help elucidate how mutations in mtDNA serve as an important factor regulating nucleocytoplasmic transcriptional dynamics during cell growth.",1
Molecular evolution of novel swine-origin A/H1N1 influenza viruses among and before human,"

The study of the molecular evolution of novel swine-origin A/H1N1 influenza viruses (SOIVs) before and amongst humans is a topic that has been gaining attention in recent years due to its implications for global public health. This paper will present an overview of existing research, focusing on the emergence, spread and characterization of SOIVs among vulnerable human populations since 2009. Our analysis will incorporate genetic data from viral isolates associated with severe manifestations of infection, such as those observed during the 2013 outbreak in Mexico. Using this information, we aim to provide conclusions regarding how environmental factors may shape SOIV transmission dynamics and ultimately increase risk for individuals involved in interspecies contact or susceptible to SOIV circulation.",1
Understanding the clinical spectrum of complicated Plasmodium vivax malaria: a systematic review on the contributions of the Brazilian literature,"

This systematic review focuses on the identification and analysis of articles from the Brazilian medical literature that address complications associated with Plasmodium vivax malaria in terms of clinical characteristics. To assess the magnitude and variation in outcomes related to complicated P. vivax malaria, a comprehensive search was undertaken in Medline/PubMed based on criteria established by Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines adapted for qualitative reviews. Based upon 28 relevant studies extracted from 762 possible candidates, it appears that neurological involvement is among the most common complications observed in this type of infection although other features such as immunological alterations also need to be taken into consideration when evaluating affected individuals. By highlighting gaps between existing knowledge regarding P. vivax infections in areas where it is endemic, this investigation enhances our capacity to properly diagnose and manage patients presenting these uncommon symptoms while providing key insights into disease epidemiology patterns which may inform prevention strategies but requires further study beyond Brazil’s borders.",1
Development and Applications of VSV Vectors Based on Cell Tropism,"

This study investigates the potential of Vesiculovirus Indiana (VSV) vectors as a novel gene delivery tool. VSV vectors have emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional viral-based gene transfer systems due to their high transduction efficiency, broad tropism and navigability. The goal of this project is to analyse the development of VSV-based vector constructs and assess their utility for cell specific applications in vitro. To achieve this aim, methods such as pulser electroporation will be utilized to deliver various combinations of dose/genetic material levels into target cells in order to elucidate optimal conditions for selective modification on a cellular level. Previous studies have indicated that variations in serotype can alter the specificity and efficacy profiles; thus known aspects related to its tropism will also be considered when determining the best system for each particular application. Subsequent analyses were performed on established clonal cell lines expressing distinct surface markers relevant for tissue specific targeting or differentiation processes. By combining both these parameters we aim at generating further insight into any combination effects between genotypical triggers and phenotypic host responses with implications beyond simple gene/protein expression patterns mediated through VSV based vectors It is expected that its outcome will provide essential data relevant towards advancement within cellular engineering disciplines looking towards versatile platform technologies held by Viral Vector Systems (vsv).",1
Soluble RAGE as a severity marker in community acquired pneumonia associated sepsis,"

The present study aims to evaluate the significance of soluble Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products (sRAGE) as a marker of clinical severity in community acquired pneumonia associated sepsis. Sepsis is a life threatening systemic inflammatory response which arises due to infection and is often accompanied by high mortality rates, particularly among elderly individuals. Despite progresses made in critical care technologies and fluid resuscitation strategies, sepsis therapeutics remain challenging. Defining early pathogenic markers involved can provide insight into potential therapeutic targets. Previous studies have established sRAGE both as an independent active participant in augmenting inflammation during injury-induced oxidative stress and its role in establishing peripheral immunity against pathogens. Thus, assessing changes within circulating levels of this biomarker holds promise for classifying disease trajectories based on their severity during episodes of sepsis complicated by pneumonia. To evaluate this connection further, the current investigation will utilize existing serum samples from patients presenting with lower respiratory tract infections to assess prognostic capacity upon various parameters such as CREA levels or risk stratification scores like CURB65 model prior candidating novel suites of predictable options that could monitor –and perhaps inform– therapeutic decision making amongst clinicians managing features secondary to CAP-sepsis scenarios",1
s-RT-MELT for rapid mutation scanning using enzymatic selection and real time DNA-melting: new potential for multiplex genetic analysis,"The rapidly growing understanding of human genetic pathways, including those that mediate cancer biology and drug response, leads to an increasing need for extensive and reliable mutation screening on a population or on a single patient basis. Here we describe s-RT-MELT, a novel technology that enables highly expanded enzymatic mutation scanning in human samples for germline or low-level somatic mutations, or for SNP discovery. GC-clamp-containing PCR products from interrogated and wild-type samples are hybridized to generate mismatches at the positions of mutations over one or multiple sequences in-parallel. Mismatches are converted to double-strand breaks using a DNA endonuclease (Surveyor™) and oligonucleotide tails are enzymatically attached at the position of mutations. A novel application of PCR enables selective amplification of mutation-containing DNA fragments. Subsequently, melting curve analysis, on conventional or nano-technology real-time PCR platforms, detects the samples that contain mutations in a high-throughput and closed-tube manner. We apply s-RT-MELT in the screening of p53 and EGFR mutations in cell lines and clinical samples and demonstrate its advantages for rapid, multiplexed mutation scanning in cancer and for genetic variation screening in biology and medicine.",0
Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A1 regulates RNA synthesis of a cytoplasmic virus,"Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP A1) is involved in pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus and translational regulation in the cytoplasm. In the present study, we demonstrate that hnRNP A1 also participates in the transcription and replication of a cytoplasmic RNA virus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Overexpression of hnRNP A1 accelerated the kinetics of viral RNA synthesis, whereas the expression in the cytoplasm of a dominant-negative hnRNP A1 mutant that lacks the nuclear transport domain significantly delayed it. The hnRNP A1 mutant caused a global inhibition of viral mRNA transcription and genomic replication, and also a preferential inhibition of the replication of defective-interfering RNAs. Similar to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the hnRNP A1 mutant complexed with an MHV polymerase gene product, the nucleocapsid protein and the viral RNA. However, in contrast to the wild-type hnRNP A1, the mutant protein failed to bind a 250 kDa cellular protein, suggesting that the recruitment of cellular proteins by hnRNP A1 is important for MHV RNA synthesis. Our findings establish the importance of cellular factors in viral RNA-dependent RNA synthesis.",0
"A cross-sectional survey to evaluate knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding seasonal influenza vaccination among European travellers to resource-limited destinations","BACKGROUND: Influenza is one of the most common vaccine-preventable diseases in travellers. By performing two cross-sectional questionnaire surveys during winter 2009 and winter 2010 among European travellers to resource-limited destinations, we aimed to investigate knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding seasonal influenza vaccination. METHODS: Questionnaires were distributed in the waiting room to the visitors of the University of Zurich Centre for Travel' Health (CTH) in January and February 2009 and January 2010 prior to travel health counselling (CTH09 and CTH10). Questions included demographic data, travel-related characteristics and KAP regarding influenza vaccination. Data were analysed by using SPSS(® )version 14.0 for Windows. Differences in proportions were compared using the Chi-square test and the significance level was set at p ≤ 0.05. Predictors for seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination were determined by multiple logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: With a response rate of 96.6%, 906 individuals were enrolled and 868 (92.5%) provided complete data. Seasonal influenza vaccination coverage was 13.7% (n = 119). Only 43 (14.2%) participants were vaccinated against pandemic influenza A/H1N1, mostly having received both vaccines simultaneously, the seasonal and pandemic one. Job-related purposes (44, 37%), age > 64 yrs (25, 21%) and recommendations of the family physician (27, 22.7%) were the most often reported reasons for being vaccinated. In the multiple logistic regression analyses of the pooled data increasing age (OR = 1.03, 95% CI 1.01 - 1.04), a business trip (OR = 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 - 0.92) and seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous winter seasons (OR = 12.91, 95% CI 8.09 - 20.58) were independent predictors for seasonal influenza vaccination in 2009 or 2010. Influenza vaccination recommended by the family doctor (327, 37.7%), travel to regions with known high risk of influenza (305, 35.1%), and influenza vaccination required for job purposes (233, 26.8%) were most frequently mentioned to consider influenza vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Risk perception and vaccination coverage concerning seasonal and pandemic influenza was very poor among travellers to resource-limited destinations when compared to traditional at-risk groups. Previous access to influenza vaccination substantially facilitated vaccinations in the subsequent year. Information strategies about influenza should be intensified and include health professionals, e.g. family physicians, travel medicine practitioners and business enterprises.",0
Epidemiology and clinical characteristics of hospitalized patients with pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 infections: the effects of bacterial coinfection,"

Epidemiology and Clinical Characteristics of Hospitalized Patients with Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Infections: The Effects of Bacterial Co-Infection 

The emergence of influenza A (H1N1) 2009, also known as swine flu, in the spring of 2009 marks an infamous event with significant global health implications. This pandemic is most notably associated with a broncho-pulmonary disorder that has resulted in widespread morbidity and mortality among infected individuals. To explore the role bacterial coinfection plays in this dynamic outbreak and its corresponding patophysiological effects on hospitalized patients, we conducted a comprehensive cross sectional study investigating patient epidemiologic profiles, clinical characteristics at admission to hospitalizing healthcare facilities and severity markers for H1N1 severe acute respiratory illness cases resulting from these infections. Descriptive epidemiology was used to identify differences between H1N1-infected patients who experienced co-bacterial infection versus those without any such pathologies or conditions. Results support previous research suggesting an increased risk for developing severe illness among certain demographic subgroups identified as being more susceptible to contract coexisting viral/bacterial complications by virtue of pre-existent immunological deficits due higher ages concentrations within population cohorts. Novel findings suggest that presence or absence additional bacterial etiologies directly impact severity outcomes before presenting require resources upon hospitalization demanding further investigation be devoted towards elucidating underlying molecular mechanism by which infections interact under diverse environmental factors faced during ongoing pandemics outbreaks worldwide.",1
Sequence specific visual detection of LAMP reactions by addition of cationic polymers,"BACKGROUND: Development of a practical gene point-of-care testing device (g-POCT device) requires innovative detection methods for demonstrating the results of the gene amplification reaction without the use of expensive equipment. We have studied a new method for the sequence-specific visual detection of minute amounts of nucleic acids using precipitation reaction by addition of cationic polymers to amplicons of Loop mediated isothermal Amplification (LAMP). RESULTS: Oligo DNA probes labeled with different fluorescent dyes were prepared for multiple nucleic acid templates, and the templates were amplified by the LAMP reactions under the existence of the probes. At completion of the LAMP reaction, an optimal amount of low molecular weight polyethylenimine (PEI) was added, resulting in the precipitation of the insoluble LAMP amplicon-PEI complex. The fluorescently labeled Oligo DNA probes hybridized to the LAMP product were incorporated into the precipitation, and the precipitate emitted fluorescence corresponding to the amplified nucleic acid templates. The color of emitted fluorescence can be detected easily by naked eye on a conventional UV illuminator. CONCLUSION: The presence or absence of minute amount of nucleic acid templates could be detected in a simple manner through visual assessment for the color of the LAMP amplicon-PEI complex precipitate. We conclude that this detection method may facilitate development of small and simple g-POCT device.",0
Public awareness of risk factors for cancer among the Japanese general population: A population-based survey,"BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to provide information on awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes among the Japanese general population. METHODS: A nationwide representative sample of 2,000 Japanese aged 20 or older was asked about their perception and level of concern about various environmental and genetic risk factors in relation to cancer prevention, as a part of an Omnibus Survey. Interviews were conducted with 1,355 subjects (609 men and 746 women). RESULTS: Among 12 risk factor candidates, the attributable fraction of cancer-causing viral and bacterial infection was considered highest (51%), followed by that of tobacco smoking (43%), stress (39%), and endocrine-disrupting chemicals (37%). On the other hand, the attributable fractions of cancer by charred fish and meat (21%) and alcohol drinking (22%) were considered low compared with other risk factor candidates. For most risk factors, attributable fraction responses were higher in women than in men. As a whole, the subjects tended to respond with higher values than those estimated by epidemiologic evidence in the West. The attributable fraction of cancer speculated to be genetically determined was 32%, while 36% of cancer was considered preventable by improving lifestyle. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that awareness of the attributable fraction of cancer causes in the Japanese general population tends to be dominated by cancer-causing infection, occupational exposure, air pollution and food additives rather than major lifestyle factors such as diet.",0
"Systematic analysis, comparison, and integration of disease based human genetic association data and mouse genetic phenotypic information","BACKGROUND: The genetic contributions to human common disorders and mouse genetic models of disease are complex and often overlapping. In common human diseases, unlike classical Mendelian disorders, genetic factors generally have small effect sizes, are multifactorial, and are highly pleiotropic. Likewise, mouse genetic models of disease often have pleiotropic and overlapping phenotypes. Moreover, phenotypic descriptions in the literature in both human and mouse are often poorly characterized and difficult to compare directly. METHODS: In this report, human genetic association results from the literature are summarized with regard to replication, disease phenotype, and gene specific results; and organized in the context of a systematic disease ontology. Similarly summarized mouse genetic disease models are organized within the Mammalian Phenotype ontology. Human and mouse disease and phenotype based gene sets are identified. These disease gene sets are then compared individually and in large groups through dendrogram analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis. RESULTS: Human disease and mouse phenotype gene sets are shown to group into disease and phenotypically relevant groups at both a coarse and fine level based on gene sharing. CONCLUSION: This analysis provides a systematic and global perspective on the genetics of common human disease as compared to itself and in the context of mouse genetic models of disease.",0
Alternative medicines for AIDS in resource-poor settings: Insights from exploratory anthropological studies in Asia and Africa,"The emergence of alternative medicines for AIDS in Asia and Africa was discussed at a satellite symposium and the parallel session on alternative and traditional treatments of the AIDSImpact meeting, held in Marseille, in July 2007. These medicines are heterogeneous, both in their presentation and in their geographic and cultural origin. The sessions focused on the role of these medications in selected resource poor settings in Africa and Asia now that access to anti-retroviral therapy is increasing. The aims of the sessions were to (1) identify the actors involved in the diffusion of these alternative medicines for HIV/AIDS, (2) explore uses and forms, and the way these medicines are given legitimacy, (3) reflect on underlying processes of globalisation and cultural differentiation, and (4) define priority questions for future research in this area. This article presents the insights generated at the meeting, illustrated with some findings from the case studies (Uganda, Senegal, Benin, Burkina Faso, China and Indonesia) that were presented. These case studies reveal the wide range of actors who are involved in the marketing and supply of alternative medicines. Regulatory mechanisms are weak. The efficacy claims of alternative medicines often reinforce a biomedical paradigm for HIV/AIDS, and fit with a healthy living ideology promoted by AIDS care programs and support groups. The AIDSImpact session concluded that more interdisciplinary research is needed on the experience of people living with HIV/AIDS with these alternative medicines, and on the ways in which these products interact (or not) with anti-retroviral therapy at pharmacological as well as psychosocial levels.",0
Differential Induction of Functional IgG Using the Plasmodium falciparum Placental Malaria Vaccine Candidate VAR2CSA,"BACKGROUND: In Plasmodium falciparum malaria endemic areas placental malaria (PM) is an important complication of malaria. The recurrence of malaria in primigravidae women irrespective of acquired protection during childhood is caused by the interaction between the parasite-expressed VAR2CSA antigen and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) in the placental intervillous space and lack of protective antibodies. PM impairs fetal development mainly by excessive inflammation processes. After infections during pregnancy women acquire immunity to PM conferred by antibodies against VAR2CSA. Ideally, a vaccine against PM will induce antibody-mediated immune responses that block the adhesion of infected erythrocytes (IE) in the placenta. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We have previously shown that antibodies raised in rat against individual domains of VAR2CSA can block IE binding to CSA. In this study we have immunized mice, rats and rabbits with each individual domain and the full-length protein corresponding to the FCR3 VAR2CSA variant. We found there is an inherently higher immunogenicity of C-terminal domains compared to N-terminally located domains. This was irrespective of whether antibodies were induced against single domains or the full-length protein. Species-specific antibody responses were also found, these were mainly directed against single domains and not the full-length VAR2CSA protein. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Binding inhibitory antibodies appeared to be against conformational B-cell epitopes. Non-binding inhibitory antibodies reacted highly against the C-terminal end of the VAR2CSA molecule especially the highly polymorphic DBL6ε domain. Differential species-specific induction of antibody responses may allow for more direct analysis of functional versus non-functional B-cell epitopes.",0
Indigenous populations health protection: A Canadian perspective,"

This paper offers an overview of the initiatives and strategies being implemented in Canada to protect the health of its indigenous populations. While considerable progress has been made, many communities continue to face significant health disparities. Drawing on case studies from across Canada, we will provide insights into the various methods adopted by governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and private sector actors to address these issues at both macro and micro levels. Additionally, we will consider how funding prioritization impacts such interventions while making recommendations for future considerations. We conclude that large scale systemic changes remain necessary accompanied with improved access to affordable healthcare services along with practical cultural sensitivity training for healthcare providers as key aspects of protecting Indigenous peoples' right to good health.",1
Molecular mechanism for 3:1 subunit stoichiometry of rod cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels,"

This article presents the unveiling of a molecular basis for the 3:1 subunit stoichiometry observed in rod cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG) ion channels. Utilizing X-ray crystallography, small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS), and electron microscopy, we resolved several structural features that are essential for understanding the assembly of CNG channels into trimeric complexes. We identified homoassociation between two subunits through contacts between their transmembrane domains and also heteroassociations utilising an intramembrane dyad found at the intersubunit junction sites that regulate channel gating functions. Moreover, our findings suggest conformational changes between intracellular regulatory domains is required for correct assembly. Together, these results demonstrate how different domains of CNGs fold together to form assemblies with defined numbers of constituent subunits as well as illuminate pathways toward engineering higher order multimers representing novel architectures appropriate for encoding specific signal processing capabilities needed in retinal cells to perform complex light sensing tasks.",1
Proteomic Investigation of Falciparum and Vivax Malaria for Identification of Surrogate Protein Markers,"

This research paper presents the findings of a proteomic investigation into falciparum and vivax malaria in order to identify surrogate protein markers. Comprehensive two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DGE) was used to analyse total proteins from the plasma of patients infected with both parasites for double spot comparisons and clustering analysis, which identified seven proteins as possible candidate markers. A mass spectrometry–based approach served to characterize and validate these proteins by comparing predicted peptides generated using silico methods with ion chromatograms acquired via MALDI time-of-flight/TOF–MS/MS instrumentation. The results show that combination of 2DGE/MALDI TOF MS is a valid method choice for monitoring biomarkers in malaria detection with greater accuracy compared to traditional diagnostic methoes such as microscopy exam or antigen test ELISA. This comprehensive method can potentially help reduce false negative cases currently encountered when using conventional tests making it an improved potential screening technique for tropical diseases setting where malaria remains endemic.

Natural Killer Cells Promote Early CD8 T Cell Responses against Cytomegalovirus,"Understanding the mechanisms that help promote protective immune responses to pathogens is a major challenge in biomedical research and an important goal for the design of innovative therapeutic or vaccination strategies. While natural killer (NK) cells can directly contribute to the control of viral replication, whether, and how, they may help orchestrate global antiviral defense is largely unknown. To address this question, we took advantage of the well-defined molecular interactions involved in the recognition of mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) by NK cells. By using congenic or mutant mice and wild-type versus genetically engineered viruses, we examined the consequences on antiviral CD8 T cell responses of specific defects in the ability of the NK cells to control MCMV. This system allowed us to demonstrate, to our knowledge for the first time, that NK cells accelerate CD8 T cell responses against a viral infection in vivo. Moreover, we identify the underlying mechanism as the ability of NK cells to limit IFN-α/β production to levels not immunosuppressive to the host. This is achieved through the early control of cytomegalovirus, which dramatically reduces the activation of plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) for cytokine production, preserves the conventional dendritic cell (cDC) compartment, and accelerates antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Conversely, exogenous IFN-α administration in resistant animals ablates cDCs and delays CD8 T cell activation in the face of NK cell control of viral replication. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the ability of NK cells to respond very early to cytomegalovirus infection critically contributes to balance the intensity of other innate immune responses, which dampens early immunopathology and promotes optimal initiation of antiviral CD8 T cell responses. Thus, the extent to which NK cell responses benefit the host goes beyond their direct antiviral effects and extends to the prevention of innate cytokine shock and to the promotion of adaptive immunity.",0
Urine Peptidomic and Targeted Plasma Protein Analyses in the Diagnosis and Monitoring of Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis,"PURPOSE: Systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis is a chronic pediatric disease. The initial clinical presentation can mimic other pediatric inflammatory conditions, which often leads to significant delays in diagnosis and appropriate therapy. SJIA biomarker development is an unmet diagnostic/prognostic need to prevent disease complications. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We profiled the urine peptidome to analyze a set of 102 urine samples, from patients with SJIA, Kawasaki disease (KD), febrile illnesses (FI), and healthy controls. A set of 91 plasma samples, from SJIA flare and quiescent patients, were profiled using a customized antibody array against 43 proteins known to be involved in inflammatory and protein catabolic processes. RESULTS: We identified a 17-urine-peptide biomarker panel that could effectively discriminate SJIA patients at active, quiescent, and remission disease states, and patients with active SJIA from confounding conditions including KD and FI. Targeted sequencing of these peptides revealed that they fall into several tight clusters from seven different proteins, suggesting disease-specific proteolytic activities. The antibody array plasma profiling identified an SJIA plasma flare signature consisting of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP1), interleukin (IL)-18, regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), P-Selectin, MMP9, and L-Selectin. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The urine peptidomic and plasma protein analyses have the potential to improve SJIA care and suggest that SJIA urine peptide biomarkers may be an outcome of inflammation-driven effects on catabolic pathways operating at multiple sites.

Studying copy number variations using a nanofluidic platform,"Copy number variations (CNVs) in the human genome are conventionally detected using high-throughput scanning technologies, such as comparative genomic hybridization and high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays, or relatively low-throughput techniques, such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All these approaches are limited in resolution and can at best distinguish a twofold (or 50%) difference in copy number. We have developed a new technology to study copy numbers using a platform known as the digital array, a nanofluidic biochip capable of accurately quantitating genes of interest in DNA samples. We have evaluated the digital array's performance using a model system, to show that this technology is exquisitely sensitive, capable of differentiating as little as a 15% difference in gene copy number (or between 6 and 7 copies of a target gene). We have also analyzed commercial DNA samples for their CYP2D6 copy numbers and confirmed that our results were consistent with those obtained independently using conventional techniques. In a screening experiment with breast cancer and normal DNA samples, the ERBB2 gene was found to be amplified in about 35% of breast cancer samples. The use of the digital array enables accurate measurement of gene copy numbers and is of significant value in CNV studies.",0
Human monoclonal IgG selection of Plasmodium falciparum for the expression of placental malaria-specific variant surface antigens,Pregnancy-associatedPlasmodium falciparum malaria (PAM) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in African women and their offspring. PAM is characterized by accumulation of infected erythrocytes (IEs) that adhere to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) in the placental intervillous space. We show here that human monoclonal IgG antibodies with specificity for variant surface antigens (VSA) specifically expressed by CSA-adhering IEs (VSA(PAM)) can be used in vitro to select parasites from nonpregnant donors to express VSA(PAM) and that this selection for VSA(PAM) expression results in preferential transcription of var2csa. The results corroborate current efforts to develop PAM-specific vaccines based on VAR2CSA.,0
"Proteomics: Challenges, Techniques and Possibilities to Overcome Biological Sample Complexity","Proteomics is the large-scale study of the structure and function of proteins in complex biological sample. Such an approach has the potential value to understand the complex nature of the organism. Current proteomic tools allow large-scale, high-throughput analyses for the detection, identification, and functional investigation of proteome. Advances in protein fractionation and labeling techniques have improved protein identification to include the least abundant proteins. In addition, proteomics has been complemented by the analysis of posttranslational modifications and techniques for the quantitative comparison of different proteomes. However, the major limitation of proteomic investigations remains the complexity of biological structures and physiological processes, rendering the path of exploration paved with various difficulties and pitfalls. The quantity of data that is acquired with new techniques places new challenges on data processing and analysis. This article provides a brief overview of currently available proteomic techniques and their applications, followed by detailed description of advantages and technical challenges. Some solutions to circumvent technical difficulties are proposed.",0
Inhibitory Influence of Enterococcus faecium on the Propagation of Swine Influenza A Virus In Vitro,"

This article examines the inhibitory influence of Enterococcus faecium on the propagation of swine influenza A virus in vitro. Swine influenza is a highly infectious, constantly evolving respiratory infection that has long been a major health threat to industrial-scale farming operations worldwide. To date there have been very few studies focusing on microbial control measures for controlling this disease in livestock production systems. Therefore, understanding the inhibitory action of certain beneficial microbes against animal viruses holds promise as an effective management tool for reducing animal-to-animal transmission and preventing outbreaks of diseases from occurring within herds. In this study we investigate the capacity of Enterococcus faecium to suppress viral replication when it was administered intranasally to pigs experimentally infected with a PCR confirmed swine flu virus strain in vitro using standard virological assays for detection and quantification. The results demonstrate that E. faecium could significantly reduce viral titres by up to 80% upon administration prior to onset or during early stages of clinical symptoms whilst having no significant effect on post symptom onset concentrations compared to untreated controls indicating potent antiviral potential against SIV A infections at symptomatic stages with proof also provided that its application need only be limited before onset or during early phase with greater efficacy noted while used around 24 hours before symptoms are visible thus requiring less labor intensity than herd wide precautionary treatment applied afterwards regardless if signs exist or not .

Influenza surveillance in the Pacific Island countries and territories during the 2009 pandemic: an observational study,"

This observational study examines the process and challenges of surveillance during the 2009 Influenza A(H1N1) pandemic in twelve Pacific Island countries and territories. During this period, concerns about varying resource constraints and low testing capacity across the region were raised, making accurate reporting a particular challenge. Through analysis of data from virological laboratory reports and other relevant sources, this paper identifies best practices for strengthening regional influenza monitoring activities in comparable global health contexts. Results revealed that rates of confirmed cases varied widely among affected nations due to geographic situation, population dynamics, and available resources' impact on disease spread. Furthermore, results indicated that delays between reported case numbers often provided governments with insufficient time to adjust effective control strategies according to changing epidemiological trends in their populations. These findings underscore the importance of continued investment in public health infrastructure within vulnerable island communities throughout the world as an important measure for controlling emerging infectious diseases like influenza A(H1N1). Ultimately these efforts may ensure more rapid response times worldwide which can reduce morbidity associated with disease outbreaks while ensuring endemic management capacity is restored immediately following such incidences",1
The CEA/CD3-Bispecific Antibody MEDI-565 (MT111) Binds a Nonlinear Epitope in the Full-Length but Not a Short Splice Variant of CEA,"

This study investigates the behavior and specificity of CEA/CD3-bispecific antibody MEDI-565 (MT111) in interaction with a full-length Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) and its splice variant CEA-deltaE5. MT111 was found to interact strongly with the full length but not with the short splice variant, suggesting that it binds nonlinearly to epitopes in the native protein structure. To understand why this binding occurs, Structural Discrimination Analysis by Spectroscopy (SDAS), Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) analysis and ImmunoPrecipitation of Endogenous proteins were used on parallel samples of both proteins. The results from this study demonstrate how conformational changes can confer differential binding and immunogenicity between two similar protein structures, illustrating an important role for post-translational modifications when designing biotherapeutic agents against tumor antigens for use in personalized cancer therapies.",1
Multiorgan failure due to hemophagocytic syndrome: A case report,"INTRODUCTION: Hemophagocytic syndrome (HFS) is a potentially lethal disorder due to an uncontrolled immune response to a triggering agent. Our objective is to raise the importance of HFS early diagnosis by presenting a representative case. CASE PRESENTATION: A sixteen-year-old girl with Still disease diagnosis developed a progressive multiorgan failure including acute respiratory distress (ARDS), anemia and thrombopenia, elevated liver enzymes, renal failure, coagulopathy with hypofibrinogenemia, and acute phase reactants elevation despite broad-spectrum antibiotics. A bone marrow puncture-biopsy was performed, and hemophagocytosis was found. Prolonged fever, splenomegaly, bicytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, hyperferritinemia and hypertriglyceridemia confirmed HFS diagnosis. She received intensive care support therapy including mechanical ventilation and specific therapy according to HLH 2004 protocol, with a very good response. CONCLUSION: Our case shows complexity of HFS diagnosis, due to septic shock-like manifestations. Early diagnosis is essential to start appropriate treatment achieving a better outcome.",0
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 autoantibodies: further evidence for a role of the renin-angiotensin system in inflammation,"Traditionally viewed as important in the regulation of blood pressure, the renin-angiotensin system - and specifically the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-angiotensin (Ang) II-AT(1 )receptor axis - may play a prominent role to promote inflammation and fibrosis. ACE2, a new component of the renin-angiotensin system, has emerged as a key enzyme that selectively degrades Ang II and generates Ang-(1-7), a bioactive peptide with anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic actions. Takahashi and colleagues demonstrate circulating titers of inhibitory autoantibodies against ACE2 in patients with systemic sclerosis. The current study reveals a potentially novel mechanism to attenuate the catalytic activity of ACE2, thereby promoting the actions of Ang II.",0
Susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial cells to different viruses,"

This study investigates the susceptibility of human retinal pigment epithelial cells (RPE) to different viruses and how it changes comparative to other cell types. The outcome of this research can provide invaluable insight into understanding disease pathology as well as vaccine efficacy. RPE are important in vision, providing essential metabolic functions and maintaining homeostasis of the photoreceptor outer segments by transporting ions and molecules between them. Therefore, their abnormal functioning has been linked with a variety of age-related eye diseases including chorioretinal dystrophies and macular degeneration. Using PCR primers targeted for E6/E7 region in high throughput qPCR analysis coupled with confocal microscopy imaging; this study aims at identifying which virus species may have higher preference toward infecting human RPE cells compared to rat’s lens transfectant (RLT) and HeLaS3 Cells line cultured under physiological condition. This could lead to a better understanding on specific pathogen-based immunization strategies effective against ocular viral diseases, ultimately leading towards improved diagnosis capabilities for clinicians around the world.

Lessons learned from the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic,"

This article examines the lessons that can be derived from analyzing the 1918–1919 influenza pandemic. It discusses how this unusual outbreak, caused by an especially virulent strain of the H1N1 virus, affected nearly one-third of the world's population and caused more deaths than any other in modern human history. The article highlights how scientific advances have since been made in such areas as viral epidemiology, early detection measures, mitigation strategies and vaccinations to combat future infectious disease outbreaks. These contemporary advances provide important lessons from humanity's encounter with this wide-spread crisis a century ago that must not be forgotten if we are to face future emergencies with confidence and resilience.",1
Risk analysis for the highly pathogenic avian influenza in Mainland China using meta-modeling,"

This article presents a novel investigation of the risk analysis for highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) in Mainland China by employing meta-modeling. The authors exploit multiple data sources and evolutionary computing techniques to systematically assess HPAI’s epidemiological features. The goal is to identify risk factors, predict epidemics and provide decision makers with a comprehensive understanding of the situation in order to implement more effective prevention strategies. Results demonstrate how ensemble modeling methodologies can generate insightful insights into the behavior of different parameters including environmental conditions, economic activity as well as social movements that bring about risks assessment for HPAI outbreaks on differing spatial scales across Mainland China.",1
Genome Stability of Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) 2009 Based on Analysis of Hemagglutinin and Neuraminidase Genes,"

This article presents a study on genome stability of the pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 virus through analysis of its hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. By studying these viral components, significant insights were gained into how this particular strain replicates and spreads among humans to cause global outbreaks. An examination was undertaken on publicly available databases for seven different countries to assess whole-gene sequence variability associated with circulating HA/NA subtypes in each region. Statistical analyses showed that not only did regional differences exist in regards to the degree of gene variation, but also revealed evidence of reassortment or intermixing between various lineages leading up to current genotypes detected since 2008-2009 pandemic emergence. This research provides a comprehensive understanding of what is known about the genomic diversity associated with H1N1 2009 enabling targeted development of novel treatment approaches and strengthened preventative measures.",1
A Clathrin Independent Macropinocytosis-Like Entry Mechanism Used by Bluetongue Virus-1 during Infection of BHK Cells,"Acid dependent infection of Hela and Vero cells by BTV-10 occurs from within early-endosomes following virus uptake by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (Forzan et al., 2007: J Virol 81: 4819–4827). Here we report that BTV-1 infection of BHK cells is also dependent on a low endosomal pH; however, virus entry and infection were not inhibited by dominant-negative mutants of Eps15, AP180 or the ‘aa’ splice variant of dynamin-2, which were shown to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. In addition, infection was not inhibited by depletion of cellular cholesterol, which suggests that virus entry is not mediated by a lipid-raft dependent process such as caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Although virus entry and infection were not inhibited by the dominant-negative dynamin-2 mutant, entry was inhibited by the general dynamin inhibitor, dynasore, indicating that virus entry is dynamin dependent. During entry, BTV-1 co-localised with LAMP-1 but not with transferrin, suggesting that virus is delivered to late-endosomal compartments without first passing through early-endosomes. BTV-1 entry and infection were inhibited by EIPA and cytochalasin-D, known macropinocytosis inhibitors, and during entry virus co-localised with dextran, a known marker for macropinocytosis/fluid-phase uptake. Our results extend earlier observations with BTV-10, and show that BTV-1 can infect BHK cells via an entry mechanism that is clathrin and cholesterol-independent, but requires dynamin, and shares certain characteristics in common with macropinocytosis.",0
Mutation patterns in human α-galactosidase A,"

This paper presents a novel study that examines the mutation patterns of human α-galactosidase A, a glycoprotein enzyme in humans critical for breaking down complex carbohydrates. By comparing genomic sequencing data from multiple individuals with different levels of clinical severity, we explore the relationship between genetic sequence and disease progression in Fabry Disease, an alpha galactosidase deficiency causing cell damage and organ failure. Significant evidence is presented to support our hypotheses on mutational burden, location within gene coding regions as well as correlations found across variants. We further discuss the implications of these findings with regards to therapeutic research for this debilitating pathology.",1
Cedar Virus: A Novel Henipavirus Isolated from Australian Bats,"

This paper presents a detailed overview of the discovery, isolation and genome sequencing of a novel Henipavirus, referred to hereafter as Cedar virus, which was found in specimens collected from Australian bats (family Pteropodidae). The Henipaviruses are members of the Paramyxoviridae family that possess both competitive and unique biological properties. It is suggested that Cedar virus likely resulted from recombination events involving Hendra virus - another member of this genus - currently known to inhabit specific regions across Australia. This study begins with an analysis of previously studied genomes orthologous to those identified in Cedar virus genome sequences obtained through next generation sequencing methods. Followed by phylogenetic analyses revealing what appear to be exclusive genetic signatures between these two viruses owing to its distinct geographic separation events occurring within Greece during ancient times. Furthermore, it discusses further critical steps necessary for understanding how this particular strain could have potentially became adapted among bat hosts located far away from the original source sequence strains previously adopted into humans and horses throughout 2020–2021 near Brisbane.",1
Bird Migration Routes and Risk for Pathogen Dispersion into Western Mediterranean Wetlands,"Wild birds share with humans the capacity for moving fast over large distances. During migratory movements, birds carry pathogens that can be transmitted between species at breeding, wintering, and stopover places where numerous birds of various species are concentrated. We consider the area of the Camargue (southern France) as an example to highlight how ad hoc information already available on birds’ movements, abundance, and diversity can help assess the introduction and transmission risk for birdborne diseases in the western Mediterranean wetlands. Avian influenza and West Nile viruses are used as examples because birds are central to the epidemiology of these viruses.",0
Clinical aspects and cytokine response in severe H1N1 influenza A virus infection,"

The clinical aspects, cytokine response and prognosis of severe influenza A virus (H1N1) infection were evaluated in this retrospective cohort study. In the present context of a pandemic caused by H1N1 influenza A virus, there is an urgent need to identify patients at risk of serious complications and develop targeted treatments. Cytokines are key host defense molecules that exert antiviral activity during infectious diseases including influenza; therefore, their analysis could provide insights into the disease progression.
This paper aimed to analyse the inflammatory response associated with severe manifestations caused by H1N1 influenza A virus infection and evaluate the impact of inflammation on clinical performance over time in adult hospitalized patients from March 2018 to April 2020 in five Brazilian teaching hospitals. Clinical data was collected regarding patient history, respiratory support - oxygen saturation levels upon admission- symptoms and physical examination results as well as laboratory results such as chest radiographs interpretations, electrolytes concentrations and biochemical tests for systemic inflammation markers – inflammatory cytokines - analyses from blood samples obtained from admitted patients with confirmed diagnosis of HINI Influenza A Virus infection were used respectively. 
Our findings showed that early identification of elevated levels TNFα , IL6 CRP prior initial onset or shortly after can be predictive marker for severity status thus providing further evidence strengths implementation strategies directed toward potential interventions available before patient aggravation worsen leading potentially fatal outcome if not treat appropriately right upon its emergence enabling healthcare professionals better understand both immune system driving status which may help clinicians assess more accurately individual's health care requirements while promptly instituting therapies personalized bases on preselected characteristics meeting specific criteria consequently alter cellular event intensities minimize pathogen invasion possibilities also improving survival rates reducing mortality chance possible given appropriate measures timely taken .

Community acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia leading to rhabdomyolysis: a case report,"Community-acquired methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is considered an underreported entity in India. In this case report, the authors describe a thirty-five year old immunocompetent male presenting with severe respiratory distress requiring intubation. On further work up, a CT thorax showed features consistent with necrotizing pneumonia. The morphology and sensitivity pattern of the organism found in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and blood culture were consistent with MRSA. The patient's stay in the hospital was complicated by acute renal failure due to rhabdomyolysis with CPK levels of 9995 U/L. The patient was started on dialysis and improved there after. This case brings to light that CA-MRSA is becoming a problem in developing nations where antibiotics are frequently used empirically with little laboratory guidance. It also is a rare reporting of rhabdomyolysis due to CA-MRSA.",0
Herpes simplex virus type 1 and normal protein permeability in the lungs of critically ill patients: a case for low pathogenicity?,"INTRODUCTION: The pathogenicity of late respiratory infections with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in the critically ill is unclear. METHODS: In four critically ill patients with persistent pulmonary infiltrates of unknown origin and isolation of HSV-1 from tracheal aspirate or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, at 7 (1–11) days after start of mechanical ventilatory support, a pulmonary leak index (PLI) for (67)Gallium ((67)Ga)-transferrin (upper limit of normal 14.1 × 10(-3)/min) was measured. RESULTS: The PLI ranged between 7.5 and 14.0 × 10(-3)/min in the study patients. Two patients received a course of acyclovir and all survived. CONCLUSIONS: The normal capillary permeability observed in the lungs argues against pathogenicity of HSV-1 in the critically ill, and favors that isolation of the virus reflects reactivation in the course of serious illness and immunodepresssion, rather than primary or superimposed infection in the lungs.",0
Using Satellite Images of Environmental Changes to Predict Infectious Disease Outbreaks,"Recent events clearly illustrate a continued vulnerability of large populations to infectious diseases, which is related to our changing human-constructed and natural environments. A single person with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 2007 provided a wake-up call to the United States and global public health infrastructure, as the health professionals and the public realized that today’s ease of airline travel can potentially expose hundreds of persons to an untreatable disease associated with an infectious agent. Ease of travel, population increase, population displacement, pollution, agricultural activity, changing socioeconomic structures, and international conflicts worldwide have each contributed to infectious disease events. Today, however, nothing is larger in scale, has more potential for long-term effects, and is more uncertain than the effects of climate change on infectious disease outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics. We discuss advances in our ability to predict these events and, in particular, the critical role that satellite imaging could play in mounting an effective response.",0
Development of Real-Time PCR Array for Simultaneous Detection of Eight Human Blood-Borne Viral Pathogens,"

This study presents the successful development of a single step real-time PCR array for simultaneous detection of eight human blood-borne viral pathogens. The complexity and cost involved in conventional laboratory diagnosis make it difficult to rapidly identify multiple viruses from a single sample, which is why there has been growing interest in developing multiplex assays using various platforms such as ELISA, microarray and RT-PCR. Subsequently, this study aims to assess the efficacy of a TaqMan chemistry based real-time PCR chip for concurrently detecting adenovirus (AdV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), herpes simplex virus types 1&2 (HSV1/2) , cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr Virus(EBV) and parvovirus B19 DNA at different concentrations and also evaluate its performance when compared with other commercially available kits. After optimization, an assay with exceptionally high analytic sensitivity was achieved over the entire range of sample dilutions. Further evaluation revealed that low Ct values were obtained even with purified samples containing very low levels of viral DNA. In conclusion, this research demonstrates robust one step real time PCR chips will provide greater accuracy in simultaneously detecting eight known human blood-borne viral pathogens while offering substantially reduced costs associated with laboratory diagnostics.",1
Molecular Mechanisms of Recombination Restriction in the Envelope Gene of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus,"The ability of pathogens to escape the host's immune response is crucial for the establishment of persistent infections and can influence virulence. Recombination has been observed to contribute to this process by generating novel genetic variants. Although distinctive recombination patterns have been described in many viral pathogens, little is known about the influence of biases in the recombination process itself relative to selective forces acting on newly formed recombinants. Understanding these influences is important for determining how recombination contributes to pathogen genome and proteome evolution. Most previous research on recombination-driven protein evolution has focused on relatively simple proteins, usually in the context of directed evolution experiments. Here, we study recombination in the envelope gene of HIV-1 between primary isolates belonging to subtypes that recombine naturally in the HIV/AIDS pandemic. By characterizing the early steps in the generation of recombinants, we provide novel insights into the evolutionary forces that shape recombination patterns within viral populations. Specifically, we show that the combined effects of mechanistic processes that determine the locations of recombination breakpoints across the HIV-1 envelope gene, and purifying selection acting against dysfunctional recombinants, can explain almost the entire distribution of breakpoints found within this gene in nature. These constraints account for the surprising paucity of recombination breakpoints found in infected individuals within this highly variable gene. Thus, the apparent randomness of HIV evolution via recombination may in fact be relatively more predictable than anticipated. In addition, the dominance of purifying selection in localized areas of the HIV genome defines regions where functional constraints on recombinants appear particularly strong, pointing to vulnerable aspects of HIV biology.",0
"An analysis of hospital preparedness capacity for public health emergency in four regions of China: Beijing, Shandong, Guangxi, and Hainan","BACKGROUND: Hospital preparedness is critical for the early detection and management of public health emergency (PHE). Understanding the current status of PHE preparedness is the first step in planning to enhance hospitals' capacities for emergency response. The objective of this study is to understand the current status of hospital PHE preparedness in China. METHODS: Four hundred hospitals in four city and provinces of China were surveyed using a standardized questionnaire. Data related to hospital demographic data; PHE preparation; response to PHE in community; stockpiles of drugs and materials; detection and identification of PHE; procedures for medical treatment; laboratory diagnosis and management; staff training; and risk communication were collected and analyzed. RESULTS: Valid responses were received from 318 (79.5%) of the 400 hospitals surveyed. Of the valid responses, 264 (85.2%) hospitals had emergency plans; 93.3% had command centres and personnel for PHE; 22.9% included community organisations during the training for PHE; 97.4% could transport needed medical staff to a PHE; 53.1% had evaluated stockpiles of drugs; 61.5% had evaluated their supply systems; 55.5% had developed surveillance systems; and 74.6% could monitor the abnormity(See in appendix). Physicians in 80.2% of the analyzed hospitals reported up-to-date knowledge of their institution's PHE protocol. Of the 318 respondents, 97.4% followed strict laboratory regulations, however, only about 33.5% had protocols for suspected samples. Furthermore, only 59.0% could isolate and identify salmonella and staphylococcus and less than 5% could isolate and identify human H5N1 avian flu and SARS. Staff training or drill programs were reported in 94.5% of the institutions; 50.3% periodically assessed the efficacy of staff training; 45% had experts to provide psychological counselling; 12.1% had provided training for their medical staff to assess PHE-related stress. All of the above capacities related to the demographic characteristics of hospitals and will be discussed in-depth in this paper. CONCLUSION: Our survey suggested that, at the time of the survey, hospital preparedness for PHE in China was at an early stage of development. Comprehensive measures should be taken to enhance hospital capacity in the prevention and management of PHE.",0
Monolayer culture of cells originating from apreimplantation bovine embryo,"

This paper presents a new method for isolating and culturing monolayers of cells derived from embryos at pre-implantation stages in bovine species. Monolayer cultures of preimplantation bovine embryo-derived cells (PBECs) were characterized using histological analysis, flow cytometry techniques, imaging fluorescence microscopy, and molecular markers. PBECs were found to be positive for cell surface responsiveness invariant markers specific to early embryonic development. Interestingly, metastatic migratory properties observed in vivo were also observed when PBECs are cultured as monolayers on plastic substrates or extracellular matrices derived from tissues known to support implantation and placentae formation during natural fertility cycle. Furthermore, our results suggest that the use of this exceptional model provides an innovative resource for the studies of cell biology associated with placental formation undergoing embryogenesis processses such as attachment structure remodeling events that can happen during miscarriages.",1
"Comparisons of substitution, insertion and deletion probes for resequencing and mutational analysis using oligonucleotide microarrays","Although oligonucleotide probes complementary to single nucleotide substitutions are commonly used in microarray-based screens for genetic variation, little is known about the hybridization properties of probes complementary to small insertions and deletions. It is necessary to define the hybridization properties of these latter probes in order to improve the specificity and sensitivity of oligonucleotide microarray-based mutational analysis of disease-related genes. Here, we compare and contrast the hybridization properties of oligonucleotide microarrays consisting of 25mer probes complementary to all possible single nucleotide substitutions and insertions, and one and two base deletions in the 9168 bp coding region of the ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) gene. Over 68 different dye-labeled single-stranded nucleic acid targets representing all ATM coding exons were applied to these microarrays. We assess hybridization specificity by comparing the relative hybridization signals from probes perfectly matched to ATM sequences to those containing mismatches. Probes complementary to two base substitutions displayed the highest average specificity followed by those complementary to single base substitutions, single base deletions and single base insertions. In all the cases, hybridization specificity was strongly influenced by sequence context and possible intra- and intermolecular probe and/or target structure. Furthermore, single nucleotide substitution probes displayed the most consistent hybridization specificity data followed by single base deletions, two base deletions and single nucleotide insertions. Overall, these studies provide valuable empirical data that can be used to more accurately model the hybridization properties of insertion and deletion probes and improve the design and interpretation of oligonucleotide microarray-based resequencing and mutational analysis.",0
The Effect of Vaccination on the Evolution and Population Dynamics of Avian Paramyxovirus-1,"Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) is a pathogenic strain of avian paramyxovirus (aPMV-1) that is among the most serious of disease threats to the poultry industry worldwide. Viral diversity is high in aPMV-1; eight genotypes are recognized based on phylogenetic reconstruction of gene sequences. Modified live vaccines have been developed to decrease the economic losses caused by this virus. Vaccines derived from avirulent genotype II strains were developed in the 1950s and are in use globally, whereas Australian strains belonging to genotype I were developed as vaccines in the 1970s and are used mainly in Asia. In this study, we evaluated the consequences of attenuated live virus vaccination on the evolution of aPMV-1 genotypes. There was phylogenetic incongruence among trees based on individual genes and complete coding region of 54 full length aPMV-1 genomes, suggesting that recombinant sequences were present in the data set. Subsequently, five recombinant genomes were identified, four of which contained sequences from either genotype I or II. The population history of vaccine-related genotype II strains was distinct from other aPMV-1 genotypes; genotype II emerged in the late 19(th) century and is evolving more slowly than other genotypes, which emerged in the 1960s. Despite vaccination efforts, genotype II viruses have experienced constant population growth to the present. In contrast, other contemporary genotypes showed population declines in the late 1990s. Additionally, genotype I and II viruses, which are circulating in the presence of homotypic vaccine pressure, have unique selection profiles compared to nonvaccine-related strains. Collectively, these data show that vaccination with live attenuated viruses has changed the evolution of aPMV-1 by maintaining a large effective population size of a vaccine-related genotype, allowing for coinfection and recombination of vaccine and wild type strains, and by applying unique selective pressures on viral glycoproteins.",0
Discovery and Genomic Characterization of a Novel Bat Sapovirus with Unusual Genomic Features and Phylogenetic Position,"

This study presents the discovery and genomic characterization of a novel sapovirus from an insectivorous bat species. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that this highly divergent strain, named Peste Bat Sapovirus (PBSV), occupied a unique position within the genus Sapovirus, implying its initial emergence in bats. Genomic comparison showed that PBSV carried two relatively conserved ORFs similar to those found in other sapoviruses as well as some regions of low-level nucleotide identity reminiscent of homologues present inother Picornaviridae genera. Moreover, phylogenetic relationships indicated recent recombination events leading to genetic diversity among closely related strains but related at distant evolutionary timescales. The detection of these unusual features confirms that bat-borne sapoviruses play an important role in virus evolution and calls for further investigation on their roles in disease outbreaks.",1
Phylodynamic Inference and Model Assessment with Approximate Bayesian Computation: Influenza as a Case Study,"

This paper examines the use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to infer phylodynamic models and assess their accuracy. Pathogen evolutionary dynamics can be a useful epidemiological tool, allowing for better detection and understanding of various infectious diseases, often with a global burden. Influenza is one such disease due to its huge prevalence worldwide; understanding the evolution dynamics at the population level allows us to predict how viruses could evolve in response to vaccination and treatments, providing vital healthcare knowledge. Recent advances in computational tools have allowed researchers unprecedented access into phylogenetic analyses that provide insights on influenza evolution. ABC permits complex data-driven decision-making based upon vast amounts of genetic information from samples from different regions around the world and offers more accurate inference than traditional approaches as it uses an explicit model comparison method rather than estimation only by parameter change processes or simulations. This article will evaluate ABC methods when applied to specific variables in influenza epidemics and discuss methodological advantages over classical phylogeny reconstruction techniques such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). Our findings will focus on situations where whole genome sequences are available which emphasizes epidemic surveillance strategies used today including tracing cases through genotype sequencing which assists surveillance data collection with careful consideration towards sampling biases while still making influential conclusions regarding virus origin tracking or local transmission patterns.",1
Early Days of Food and Environmental Virology,"In July 1962, the author joined the Food Research Institute (FRI), then at the University of Chicago, to become its food virologist. There was a limited record of waterborne viral disease outbreaks at the time; recorded data on foodborne outbreaks were fewer still. Laboratory environmental (water and wastewater) virology was in its infancy, and food virology was in gestation. Detection of viruses was most often attempted by inoculation of primary primate cell cultures, with observation for plaque formation or cytopathic effects. Focus was initially on enteroviruses and reoviruses. Environmental and food samples had to be liquefied if not already in liquid form; clarified to remove solids, bacteria, and fungi; and concentrated to a volume that could be tested in cell culture. Cytotoxicity was also a concern. Studies at the FRI and some other laboratories addressed all of these challenges. The FRI group was the World Health Organization’s Collaborating Center for Food Virology for many years. Other topics studied were virus inactivation as functions of temperature, time, matrix, disinfectants, and microbial action; peroral and ex-vivo infectivity; and the suitability of various virus surrogates for environmental monitoring and inactivation experiments. Detection of noroviruses and hepatitis A virus required molecular methods, most often RT-PCR. When it was found that inactivated virus often gave the same RT-PCR signal as that of infectious virus, sample treatments were sought, which would prevent false-positive test results. Many laboratories around the world have taken up food and environmental virology since 1962, with the result that a dedicated journal has been launched.",0
Network Analysis of Global Influenza Spread,"Although vaccines pose the best means of preventing influenza infection, strain selection and optimal implementation remain difficult due to antigenic drift and a lack of understanding global spread. Detecting viral movement by sequence analysis is complicated by skewed geographic and seasonal distributions in viral isolates. We propose a probabilistic method that accounts for sampling bias through spatiotemporal clustering and modeling regional and seasonal transmission as a binomial process. Analysis of H3N2 not only confirmed East-Southeast Asia as a source of new seasonal variants, but also increased the resolution of observed transmission to a country level. H1N1 data revealed similar viral spread from the tropics. Network analysis suggested China and Hong Kong as the origins of new seasonal H3N2 strains and the United States as a region where increased vaccination would maximally disrupt global spread of the virus. These techniques provide a promising methodology for the analysis of any seasonal virus, as well as for the continued surveillance of influenza.",0
Persistent Expression of Hepatitis C Virus Non-Structural Proteins Leads to Increased Autophagy and Mitochondrial Injury in Human Hepatoma Cells,"

The persistent expression of hepatitis C virus (HCV) non-structural proteins has been shown to induce cytotoxicity and disrupt normal liver functions, but the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate these molecular events by analyzing the effects of sustained HCV NS protein expression on autophagy and mitochondrial injury in cultured human hepatoma cells. Autophagosome formation was monitored over time with a fluorescent stain, while mitochondrial injury was evaluated based on membrane potential changes and oxidative damage levels. The results suggest that sustained HCV NS proteins in hepatoma cells increase both autophagy flux and mitochondrial stress, leading to cell death through necrotic pathways or apoptosis when other conditions are favorable. Our findings provide new insight into the mechanisms by which HCV infections impair cellular functions in human hepatocytes, indicating that increased autophagy and subsequent mitochondria damage might act as key drivers for cell death during chronic viral infection. These novel findings offer promise for developing antiviral therapies targeting regulated intracellular processes associated with disrupted liver homeostasis caused by persistent viral replication in host cells.",1
Relative cost and outcomes in the intensive care unit of acute lung injury (ALI) due to pandemic influenza compared with other etiologies: a single-center study,"

The title of this study is 'Relative Cost and Outcomes in the Intensive Care Unit of Acute Lung Injury (ALI) due to Pandemic Influenza Compared with Other Etiologies: A Single-Center Study'. Acute lung injury (ALI) due to pandemic influenza has been on the rise since 2009, when the novel H1N1 virus originated from Mexico. In severe cases it requires intensive care management which can be extremely costly for individuals and healthcare systems alike. The objective of this research was to examine whether there are differences between patients in an intensive care unit or ICU who were admitted with ALI caused by either pandemic influenza or other etiologies in terms of mortality, length of stay and associated costs.

This study utilized retrospective case note review data from a single center hospital's medical records database for all adult admissions over a three-year period diagnosed with ALU related to either pandemic influenza or another etiology comprised mainly pneumonia resulting from bacterial infections, upper respiratory tract illnesses such as bronchitis, pulmonary edema amongst others. Clinical parameters analyzed included mortality status at discharge;ICUlengthof stay; total cost incurred during hospitalization including investigational tests etc.; use and types antibiotic medications used; steroid administration rate; extracorporeal membrane oxygenation rates if applicable along with ventilator support duration required among other clinical indicators.

Results showed that while both groups experienced significant mortality levels overall pandemics flu incited higher death rate than those admitted due to other causes (34% vs 21%). Also admission length was longer representing extra expenditure increasing median cost upto US$50,134 accompanied by higher utilization xanthines antibiotics needs meanwhile complication rates closely matched findings 5%. Findings outlined herein implies relative expensiveis attributable largely totimely diagnosis  increased monitoring requirements imposed need for stringent treatment alongside implementation preventive measures amongst public population group thereby reducing disease incidence responsible ensuing burden generated extensive health services utilisation .",1
"Influenza Virus (H5N1) in Live Bird Markets and Food Markets, Thailand",A surveillance program for influenza A viruses (H5N1) was conducted in live bird and food markets in central Thailand during July 2006–August 2007. Twelve subtype H5N1 viruses were isolated. The subtype H5N1 viruses circulating in the markets were genetically related to those that circulated in Thailand during 2004–2005.,0
Successful treatment of Chlamydophila pneumoniae acute respiratory distress syndrome with extracorporeal membrane oxygenator: a case report and diagnostic review,"

This paper presents an analysis of a successful response to Chlamydophila pneumoniae acute respiratory distress syndrome (APDS) in a patient, which was achieved through extracorporeal membrane oxygenator treatment. It descriptively reviews the case, addressing the diagnosis, medical and therapeutic approach used during this successful care episode. The condition prevalence and associated pathologic processes are discussed along with available evidence for medical management of affected individuals. The authors call for further research on this difficult-to-treat anomaly and suggest thoughtfully designed trials that will address novel valid therapeutic strategies for ABDS patients. This timely report provides promising insights into the potential success of ECMO therapy as a safe and effective managment option for people suffering from APDS due to Cpn infection.",1
Screen for ISG15-crossreactive Deubiquitinases,"BACKGROUND: The family of ubiquitin-like molecules (UbLs) comprises several members, each of which has sequence, structural, or functional similarity to ubiquitin. ISG15 is a homolog of ubiquitin in vertebrates and is strongly upregulated following induction by type I interferon. ISG15 can be covalently attached to proteins, analogous to ubiquitination and with actual support of ubiquitin conjugating factors. Specific proteases are able to reverse modification with ubiquitin or UbLs by hydrolyzing the covalent bond between their C-termini and substrate proteins. The tail regions of ubiquitin and ISG15 are identical and we therefore hypothesized that promiscuous deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs) might exist, capable of recognizing both ubiquitin and ISG15. RESULTS: We have cloned and expressed 22 human DUBs, representing the major clades of the USP protease family. Utilizing suicide inhibitors based on ubiquitin and ISG15, we have identified USP2, USP5 (IsoT1), USP13 (IsoT3), and USP14 as ISG15-reactive proteases, in addition to the bona fide ISG15-specific protease USP18 (UBP43). USP14 is a proteasome-associated DUB, and its ISG15 isopeptidase activity increases when complexed with the proteasome. CONCLUSIONS: By evolutionary standards, ISG15 is a newcomer among the UbLs and it apparently not only utilizes the conjugating but also the deconjugating machinery of its more established relative ubiquitin. Functional overlap between these two posttranslational modifiers might therefore be more extensive than previously appreciated and explain the rather innocuous phenotype of ISG15 null mice.",0
Normal variation in thermal radiated temperature in cattle: implications for foot-and-mouth disease detection,"

This study addresses the implications of normal temperature variation in cattle for detecting the foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). The research assesses whether standard infrared thermography measurement systems that are commonly used to detect FMD can still accurately differentiate between infected and noninfected animals when faced with normal variation in thermal radiation. A systematic review of peer-reviewed literature was conducted, incorporating data from public sources such as journals, books and online databases. Results indicate that there may be some thermal evidence associated with FMD but no clear guidance is currently available about how best to interpret it if within range for noninfected individuals. As a result, further research is warranted to explore improved metrics for better identifying diseased populations amongst varying background temperatures.",1
Molecular dynamics simulations of human [Formula: see text]: the role of modified bases in mRNA recognition,"Accuracy in translation of the genetic code into proteins depends upon correct tRNA–mRNA recognition in the context of the ribosome. In human [Formula: see text] three modified bases are present in the anticodon stem–loop—2-methylthio-N6-threonylcarbamoyladenosine at position 37 (ms(2)t(6)A37), 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl-2-thiouridine at position 34 (mcm(5)s(2)U34) and pseudouridine (ψ) at position 39—two of which, ms(2)t(6)A37 and mcm(5)s(2)U34, are required to achieve wild-type binding activity of wild-type human [Formula: see text] [C. Yarian, M. Marszalek, E. Sochacka, A. Malkiewicz, R. Guenther, A. Miskiewicz and P. F. Agris (2000) Biochemistry, 39, 13390–13395]. Molecular dynamics simulations of nine tRNA anticodon stem–loops with different combinations of nonstandard bases were performed. The wild-type simulation exhibited a canonical anticodon stair-stepped conformation. The ms(2)t(6) modification at position 37 is required for maintenance of this structure and reduces solvent accessibility of U36. Ms(2)t(6)A37 generally hydrogen bonds across the loop and may prevent U36 from rotating into solution. A water molecule does coordinate to ψ39 most of the simulation time but weakly, as most of the residence lifetimes are <40 ps.",0
Design and management of an orthopaedic bone bank in the Netherlands,"

'Design and management of an orthopaedic bone bank in the Netherlands': This article explores how to design and manage an effective Orthopaedic Bone Bank for best practice throughout The Netherlands. Utilizing evidence-based research, this study seeks to provide insight into the key considerations taken when establishing a Bone Bank, including but not limited to regulatory compliance with related biosecurity laws, standard operational procedures such as infection control protocols, financial oversight necessary for proper functioning of centres and secure storage solutions required. In addition to quantitative analysis on usage statistics such as mortality rate among donors and success rate/resource turnover; qualitative data collection from patient focus groups are also deployed in order to obtain maximum value from current systems. It is hoped that findings may be deemed suitable for adoption by other national health bodies striving for safe tissue procurement methods for improved patient care outcomes.",1
Using Dynamic Stochastic Modelling to Estimate Population Risk Factors in Infectious Disease: The Example of FIV in 15 Cat Populations,"BACKGROUND: In natural cat populations, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) is transmitted through bites between individuals. Factors such as the density of cats within the population or the sex-ratio can have potentially strong effects on the frequency of fight between individuals and hence appear as important population risk factors for FIV. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To study such population risk factors, we present data on FIV prevalence in 15 cat populations in northeastern France. We investigate five key social factors of cat populations; the density of cats, the sex-ratio, the number of males and the mean age of males and females within the population. We overcome the problem of dependence in the infective status data using sexually-structured dynamic stochastic models. Only the age of males and females had an effect (p = 0.043 and p = 0.02, respectively) on the male-to-female transmission rate. Due to multiple tests, it is even likely that these effects are, in reality, not significant. Finally we show that, in our study area, the data can be explained by a very simple model that does not invoke any risk factor. CONCLUSION: Our conclusion is that, in host-parasite systems in general, fluctuations due to stochasticity in the transmission process are naturally very large and may alone explain a larger part of the variability in observed disease prevalence between populations than previously expected. Finally, we determined confidence intervals for the simple model parameters that can be used to further aid in management of the disease.",0
"Horizontal Transposon Transfer in Eukarya: Detection, Bias, and Perspectives","

Research into the genomic contributions of mobile genetic elements, such as transposons, continues to surge in relevance due to their known role in both genotype and phenotype-shaping. Lately, it has become clear that horizontal transfer between organisms is a major contributor to genomic divergence and many species’ adaptation. This study focuses on the detection, bias consideration, and perspectives of one particular group of these elements: horizontal transposon transfer in Eukarya. Through analysis driven by diverse sequencing techniques, this paper presents evidence supporting the wide existence and scope of chromatin mobility between related species found today. From there we consider how the current existing identification techniques affect our data collection accuracy and discuss further implications. Finally — through exploring novel approaches — we demonstrate optimistic prospects for uncovering yet more previously unknown aspects related to horizontal railingson transfers in eukaryote genomes.",1
On epidemic modeling in real time: An application to the 2009 Novel A (H1N1) influenza outbreak in Canada,"BACKGROUND: Management of emerging infectious diseases such as the 2009 influenza pandemic A (H1N1) poses great challenges for real-time mathematical modeling of disease transmission due to limited information on disease natural history and epidemiology, stochastic variation in the course of epidemics, and changing case definitions and surveillance practices. FINDINGS: The Richards model and its variants are used to fit the cumulative epidemic curve for laboratory-confirmed pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) infections in Canada, made available by the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC). The model is used to obtain estimates for turning points in the initial outbreak, the basic reproductive number (R(0)), and for expected final outbreak size in the absence of interventions. Confirmed case data were used to construct a best-fit 2-phase model with three turning points. R(0 )was estimated to be 1.30 (95% CI 1.12-1.47) for the first phase (April 1 to May 4) and 1.35 (95% CI 1.16-1.54) for the second phase (May 4 to June 19). Hospitalization data were also used to fit a 1-phase model with R(0 )= 1.35 (1.20-1.49) and a single turning point of June 11. CONCLUSIONS: Application of the Richards model to Canadian pH1N1 data shows that detection of turning points is affected by the quality of data available at the time of data usage. Using a Richards model, robust estimates of R(0 )were obtained approximately one month after the initial outbreak in the case of 2009 A (H1N1) in Canada.",0
Professional and Home-Made Face Masks Reduce Exposure to Respiratory Infections among the General Population,"BACKGROUND: Governments are preparing for a potential influenza pandemic. Therefore they need data to assess the possible impact of interventions. Face-masks worn by the general population could be an accessible and affordable intervention, if effective when worn under routine circumstances. METHODOLOGY: We assessed transmission reduction potential provided by personal respirators, surgical masks and home-made masks when worn during a variety of activities by healthy volunteers and a simulated patient. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: All types of masks reduced aerosol exposure, relatively stable over time, unaffected by duration of wear or type of activity, but with a high degree of individual variation. Personal respirators were more efficient than surgical masks, which were more efficient than home-made masks. Regardless of mask type, children were less well protected. Outward protection (mask wearing by a mechanical head) was less effective than inward protection (mask wearing by healthy volunteers). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Any type of general mask use is likely to decrease viral exposure and infection risk on a population level, in spite of imperfect fit and imperfect adherence, personal respirators providing most protection. Masks worn by patients may not offer as great a degree of protection against aerosol transmission.",0
Neutralizing Antibody Fails to Impact the Course of Ebola Virus Infection in Monkeys,"Prophylaxis with high doses of neutralizing antibody typically offers protection against challenge with viruses producing acute infections. In this study, we have investigated the ability of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody, KZ52, to protect against Ebola virus in rhesus macaques. This antibody was previously shown to fully protect guinea pigs from infection. Four rhesus macaques were given 50 mg/kg of neutralizing human monoclonal antibody KZ52 intravenously 1 d before challenge with 1,000 plaque-forming units of Ebola virus, followed by a second dose of 50 mg/kg antibody 4 d after challenge. A control animal was exposed to virus in the absence of antibody treatment. Passive transfer of the neutralizing human monoclonal antibody not only failed to protect macaques against challenge with Ebola virus but also had a minimal effect on the explosive viral replication following infection. We show that the inability of antibody to impact infection was not due to neutralization escape. It appears that Ebola virus has a mechanism of infection propagation in vivo in macaques that is uniquely insensitive even to high concentrations of neutralizing antibody.",0
Proteasome-Dependent Disruption of the E3 Ubiquitin Ligase Anaphase-Promoting Complex by HCMV Protein pUL21a,"

This study examines the proteasome-dependent disruption of the E3 ubiquitin ligase anaphase promoting complex (APC) by Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) protein, pUL21a. The APC has a major role in cycling proteins throughout the cell cycle, but pUL21a offers supplementary control over its activity. Using validated biochemical assays and mass spectrometry to identify components of pUL21a-interacting complexes, this study reveals that HCMV is capable of inhibiting APC's Ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation activities through direct interactions with TIP60 and USP14. This inhibited function results in a decrease in cyclosporine A dethreading for target proteins promoted by human deubiquitylases inhibition leading to reduced stability ultimately resulting in their degradation. Results from this work demonstrate how disrupting the APC could lead to increased virus replication at specific stages during cellular infection and highlights potential ways for further investigation into similar models affecting antiviral pathways within infected cells.",1
A flexible loop in yeast ribosomal protein L11 coordinates P-site tRNA binding,"High-resolution structures reveal that yeast ribosomal protein L11 and its bacterial/archael homologs called L5 contain a highly conserved, basically charged internal loop that interacts with the peptidyl-transfer RNA (tRNA) T-loop. We call this the L11 ‘P-site loop’. Chemical protection of wild-type ribosome shows that that the P-site loop is inherently flexible, i.e. it is extended into the ribosomal P-site when this is unoccupied by tRNA, while it is retracted into the terminal loop of 25S rRNA Helix 84 when the P-site is occupied. To further analyze the function of this structure, a series of mutants within the P-site loop were created and analyzed. A mutant that favors interaction of the P-site loop with the terminal loop of Helix 84 promoted increased affinity for peptidyl-tRNA, while another that favors its extension into the ribosomal P-site had the opposite effect. The two mutants also had opposing effects on binding of aa-tRNA to the ribosomal A-site, and downstream functional effects were observed on translational fidelity, drug resistance/hypersensitivity, virus maintenance and overall cell growth. These analyses suggest that the L11 P-site loop normally helps to optimize ribosome function by monitoring the occupancy status of the ribosomal P-site.",0
Unifying evolutionary and thermodynamic information for RNA folding of multiple alignments,"Computational methods for determining the secondary structure of RNA sequences from given alignments are currently either based on thermodynamic folding, compensatory base pair substitutions or both. However, there is currently no approach that combines both sources of information in a single optimization problem. Here, we present a model that formally integrates both the energy-based and evolution-based approaches to predict the folding of multiple aligned RNA sequences. We have implemented an extended version of Pfold that identifies base pairs that have high probabilities of being conserved and of being energetically favorable. The consensus structure is predicted using a maximum expected accuracy scoring scheme to smoothen the effect of incorrectly predicted base pairs. Parameter tuning revealed that the probability of base pairing has a higher impact on the RNA structure prediction than the corresponding probability of being single stranded. Furthermore, we found that structurally conserved RNA motifs are mostly supported by folding energies. Other problems (e.g. RNA-folding kinetics) may also benefit from employing the principles of the model we introduce. Our implementation, PETfold, was tested on a set of 46 well-curated Rfam families and its performance compared favorably to that of Pfold and RNAalifold.",0
Increased Host Species Diversity and Decreased Prevalence of Sin Nombre Virus,"Emerging outbreaks of zoonotic diseases are affecting humans at an alarming rate. Until the ecological factors associated with zoonoses are better understood, disease emergence will continue. For Lyme disease, disease suppression has been demonstrated by a dilution effect, whereby increasing species diversity decreases disease prevalence in host populations. To test the dilution effect in another disease, we examined 17 ecological variables associated with prevalence of the directly transmitted Sin Nombre virus (genus Hantavirus, etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) in its wildlife host, the deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus). Only species diversity was statistically linked to infection prevalence: as species diversity decreased, infection prevalence increased. The increase was moderate, but prevalence increased exponentially at low levels of diversity, a phenomenon described as zoonotic release. The results suggest that species diversity affects disease emergence.",0
Development of TaqMan(® )MGB fluorescent real-time PCR assay for the detection of anatid herpesvirus 1,"BACKGROUND: Anatid herpesvirus 1 (AHV-1) is an alphaherpesvirus associated with latent infection and mortality in ducks and geese and is currently affecting the world-wide waterfowl production severely. Here we describe a fluorescent quantitative real-time PCR (FQ-PCR) method developed for fast measurement of AHV-1 DNA based on TaqMan MGB technology. RESULTS: The detection limit of the assay was 1 × 10(1 )standard DNA copies, with a sensitivity of 2 logs higher than that of the conventional gel-based PCR assay targeting the same gene. The real-time PCR was reproducible, as shown by satisfactory low intra-assay and inter-assay coefficients of variation. CONCLUSION: The high sensitivity, specificity, simplicity and reproducibility of the AHV-1 fluorogenic PCR assay, combined with its wide dynamic range and high throughput, make this method suitable for a broad spectrum of AHV-1 etiologically related application.",0
Dengue Virus Virulence and Transmission Determinants,"The mechanisms of dengue virus (DENV) pathogenesis are little understood because we have no models of disease; only humans develop symptoms (dengue fever, DF, or dengue hemorrhagic fever, DHF) and research has been limited to studies involving patients. DENV is very diverse: there are four antigenic groups (serotypes) and three to five genetic groups (genotypes) within each serotype. Thus, it has been difficult to evaluate the relative virulence or transmissibility of each DENV genotype; both of these factors are important determinants of epidemiology and their measurement is complex because the natural cycle of this disease involves human-mosquito-human transmission. Although epidemiological and evolutionary studies have pointed to viral factors in determining disease outcome, only recently developed models could prove the importance of specific viral genotypes in causing severe epidemics and their potential to spread to other continents. These new models involve infection of primary human cell cultures, “humanized” mice and field-collected mosquitoes; also, new mathematical models can estimate the impact of viral replication, human immunity and mosquito transmission on epidemic behavior. DENV evolution does not seem to be rapid and the transmission and dispersal of stable, replication-fit genotypes has been more important in the causation of more severe epidemics. Controversy regarding viral determinants of DENV pathogenesis and epidemiology will continue until virulence and transmissibility can be measured under various conditions.",0
Transmissibility of the Influenza Virus in the 1918 Pandemic,"BACKGROUND: With a heightened increase in concern for an influenza pandemic we sought to better understand the 1918 Influenza pandemic, the most devastating epidemic of the previous century. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We use data from several communities in Maryland, USA as well as two ships that experienced well-documented outbreaks of influenza in 1918. Using a likelihood-based method and a nonparametric method, we estimate the serial interval and reproductive number throughout the course of each outbreak. This analysis shows the basic reproductive number to be slightly lower in the Maryland communities (between 1.34 and 3.21) than for the enclosed populations on the ships (R(0) = 4.97, SE = 3.31). Additionally the effective reproductive number declined to sub epidemic levels more quickly on the ships (within around 10 days) than in the communities (within 30–40 days). The mean serial interval for the ships was consistent (3.33, SE = 5.96 and 3.81, SE = 3.69), while the serial intervals in the communities varied substantially (between 2.83, SE = 0.53 and 8.28, SE = 951.95). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results illustrate the importance of considering the population dynamics when making statements about the epidemiological parameters of Influenza. The methods that we employ for estimation of the reproductive numbers and the serial interval can be easily replicated in other populations and with other diseases.",0
The use of loop-mediated isothermal DNA amplification for the detection and identification of the anthrax pathogen,"

This study investigates the applicability of Loop-Mediated Isothermal DNA Amplification (LAMP) for detecting and identifying the anthrax pathogen. Anthrax is an increasingly serious global health threat requiring rapid and reliable detection methods. The current gold standard in diagnostics, PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), requires expensive instrumentation due to its complexity. LAMP offers a cost-effective solution with greater simplicity than other molecular assaying techniques which are commonly used for disease diagnosis. To investigate the effectiveness of this method, samples from various sources were exposed to LAMP reagents targeting anthrax virulence genes at 37°C on an Ebio rotor system before being analyzed through agarose gel electrophoresis interpretation. Results showed that LAMP can accurately identify and detect the presence of potential threats such as Bacillus anthracis with maximum sensitivity in minimum processing time allowing further assessment or management strategies against hazards resulting from possible outbreaks or exposure.",1
EBV-gp350 Confers B-Cell Tropism to Tailored Exosomes and Is a Neo-Antigen in Normal and Malignant B Cells—A New Option for the Treatment of B-CLL,"

The Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) glycoprotein 350 (gp350) has been identified as a leading therapeutic target for the treatment of B-cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (B-CLL). In this study, we address the effect of EBV gp350 on tailored exosomes and explore its potential function as a neoantigen in both normal and malignant B cells. Furthermore, we discuss how this knowledge may be used to develop anti-tumor treatments. Flow cytometric analyses were conducted to observe an increase in binding affinity of serum exosome targeting probes to gp350+ myeloid cells following genetic recombination approaches such as transfection, lipofection and electroporation into NIH3T3, Raji and Ramos cell lines. Immunohistochemistry analysis was also completed using tissue microarray which revealed positive staining signal in majority (>80%) of CLL lymphocytes expressing gp350. These results imply that EBV gp350 is capable of conferring B cell tropism to specifically tailored exosomes thereby giving it the capacity to serve as an effective neoantigen against malignant B cells including those with high degrees of chromosomal abnormalities or those from relapsed therapy patients not eligible for more intense interventions. Thus it can potentially provide clinicians a novel approach towards treating CLL patients by boosting adaptive immunity through delivery systems relying on complex assimilations similar in nature; hence providing insight into new drug development strategies involving personalized medicine techniques.",1

Comparison of percutaneous radiofrequency thermal ablation and surgical resection for small hepatocellular carcinoma,"

This article utilizes a comparative study to analyze the efficiency of two medical procedures which are employed for treating small hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). A retrospective analysis examining the respective characteristics and outcomes associated with both percutaneous radiofrequency thermal ablation (PRFTA) and surgical resection is presented. The aim of this research was to determine which of these methods offered patients more effective treatment results in terms of tumor control, safety factors such as potential complications, hospital stay duration, success rate and cost-effectiveness. All records were extracted from two prominent hospitals over a period four years commencing in 2013 to 2017; patient data comprising 345 individuals complied with criteria used for conducting our research. Findings indicate that PRFTA should be given due consideration prior to opting for surgery since it is non-invasive, cost-efficient while still retaining its efficacy if appropriately applied by healthcare practitioners. This suggests that although an operation confers greater effectiveness than PRFTA in some cases, careful selection significantly reduces its use while relieving financial pressure on both civilian possessor and institutions alike.

The presence of the TAR RNA structure alters the programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift efficiency of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) by modifying the rate of translation initiation,"HIV-1 uses a programmed -1 ribosomal frameshift to synthesize the precursor of its enzymes, Gag-Pol. The frameshift efficiency that is critical for the virus replication, is controlled by an interaction between the ribosome and a specific structure on the viral mRNA, the frameshift stimulatory signal. The rate of cap-dependent translation initiation is known to be altered by the TAR RNA structure, present at the 5′ and 3′ end of all HIV-1 mRNAs. Depending upon its concentration, TAR activates or inhibits the double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR). We investigated here whether changes in translation initiation caused by TAR affect HIV-1 frameshift efficiency. CD4+ T cells and 293T cells were transfected with a dual-luciferase construct where the firefly luciferase expression depends upon the HIV-1 frameshift. Translation initiation was altered by adding TAR in cis or trans of the reporter mRNA. We show that HIV-1 frameshift efficiency correlates negatively with changes in the rate of translation initiation caused by TAR and mediated by PKR. A model is presented where changes in the rate of initiation affect the probability of frameshifting by altering the distance between elongating ribosomes on the mRNA, which influences the frequency of encounter between these ribosomes and the frameshift stimulatory signal.",0
Antidiabetes and Anti-obesity Activity of Lagerstroemia speciosa,"The leaves of Lagerstroemia speciosa (Lythraceae), a Southeast Asian tree more commonly known as banaba, have been traditionally consumed in various forms by Philippinos for treatment of diabetes and kidney related diseases. In the 1990s, the popularity of this herbal medicine began to attract the attention of scientists worldwide. Since then, researchers have conducted numerous in vitro and in vivo studies that consistently confirmed the antidiabetic activity of banaba. Scientists have identified different components of banaba to be responsible for its activity. Using tumor cells as a cell model, corosolic acid was isolated from the methanol extract of banaba and shown to be an active compound. More recently, a different cell model and the focus on the water soluble fraction of the extract led to the discovery of other compounds. The ellagitannin Lagerstroemin was identified as an effective component of the banaba extract responsible for the activity. In a different approach, using 3T3-L1 adipocytes as a cell model and a glucose uptake assay as the functional screening method, Chen et al. showed that the banaba water extract exhibited an insulin-like glucose transport inducing activity. Coupling HPLC fractionation with a glucose uptake assay, gallotannins were identified in the banaba extract as components responsible for the activity, not corosolic acid. Penta-O-galloyl-glucopyranose (PGG) was identified as the most potent gallotannin. A comparison of published data with results obtained for PGG indicates that PGG has a significantly higher glucose transport stimulatory activity than Lagerstroemin. Chen et al. have also shown that PGG exhibits anti-adipogenic properties in addition to stimulating the glucose uptake in adipocytes. The combination of glucose uptake and anti-adipogenesis activity is not found in the current insulin mimetic drugs and may indicate a great therapeutic potential of PGG.",0
Pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus with the H275Y oseltamivir resistance neuraminidase mutation shows a small compromise in enzyme activity and viral fitness,"BACKGROUND: Resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir can be conferred by a well-characterized mutation in the neuraminidase gene, H275Y. In human H1N1 viruses that circulated in the first years of the 21st century, this mutation carried a fitness cost and resistant viruses were rare. During the 2007–08 influenza season, oseltamivir-resistant viruses of H1N1 phenotype emerged and predominated. March 2009 saw the emergence of a novel H1N1 influenza pandemic. We examined whether the H275Y mutation affected neuraminidase enzyme activity or replication of the pandemic influenza virus. METHODS: Using reverse genetics we engineered the H275Y mutation into the neuraminidase of a 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus and assessed the ability of this enzyme to desialylate mono- and multivalent substrates. The growth kinetics of wild-type and mutant viruses were assessed in Madin–Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and fully differentiated human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. RESULTS: The presence of H275Y was associated with a 1.3-fold decrease in the affinity of the neuraminidase for a monovalent substrate and a 4-fold compromise in desialylation of multivalent substrate. This was associated with a fitness cost to viral replication in vitro, which only became apparent during competitive replication in the mucus-rich HAE culture system. CONCLUSIONS: The neuraminidase protein of pandemic influenza isolates tolerates the H275Y mutation and this mutation confers resistance to oseltamivir. However, unlike seasonal H1N1 viruses isolated since 2007, the mutation is not associated with any fitness advantage and thus is unlikely to predominate without further antigenic drift, compensating mutations or intense selection pressure.",0
Pilot Evaluation of RT-PCR/Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (PLEX-ID/Flu assay) on Influenza-Positive Specimens,"

This paper reports on a pilot study evaluating the efficacy of RT-PCR/Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (PLEX-ID/Flu) assay in identifying influenza positive specimens. The PLEX-ID/Flu approach offers an improved method for rapid and accurate detection of known and novel viruses, as well being inherently more reliable than traditional assays. The aim was to examine the performance characteristics of this new technology and explore potential areas for improvement. To assess accuracy, real time PCR results were compared to those obtained from the PLEX-ID/Flu assay with samples from influenza positive specimens collected from both pediatric and adult populations over a 1 month period. Results showed that PLEX-ISD/Flu identified 100% of tested samples correctly indicating high levels of sensitivity and specificity for three major virus subtypes: A(H1N1), A(H3N2), B strains including some new strains discovered only recently. Overall findings indicate that PLAX-ISD / Flu has strong diagnosing capability as a tool for detecting Influenza thus providing clinically actionable information enabling appropriate patient management decisions in a timely manner.",1
Delivery Systems for the Direct Application of siRNAs to Induce RNA Interference (RNAi) In Vivo,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a powerful method for specific gene silencing which may also lead to promising novel therapeutic strategies. It is mediated through small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) which sequence-specifically trigger the cleavage and subsequent degradation of their target mRNA. One critical factor is the ability to deliver intact siRNAs into target cells/organs in vivo. This review highlights the mechanism of RNAi and the guidelines for the design of optimal siRNAs. It gives an overview of studies based on the systemic or local application of naked siRNAs or the use of various nonviral siRNA delivery systems. One promising avenue is the the complexation of siRNAs with the polyethylenimine (PEI), which efficiently stabilizes siRNAs and, upon systemic administration, leads to the delivery of the intact siRNAs into different organs. The antitumorigenic effects of PEI/siRNA-mediated in vivo gene-targeting of tumor-relevant proteins like in mouse tumor xenograft models are described.",0
"CD4(+) T-Cell Expansion Predicts Neutralizing Antibody Responses to Monovalent, Inactivated 2009 Pandemic Influenza A(H1N1) Virus Subtype H1N1 Vaccine","

This paper explores the relationship between CD4(+) T-cell expansion and an antibody response to the 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) virus subtype H1N1 vaccine. With concerns of rapid spread worldwide, scientists have long been aware of the potential threat posed by this novel influenza strain. An effective way to reduce its effects is through immunization with a monovalent inactivated whole virus vaccine. The current study investigates whether responses to such a vaccine correlates to CD4(+) cell expansion upon vaccination and at 1 month following it. We use data from a randomized trial, in which serum samples were collected pre-vaccination as well as 1 week and 1 month after vaccination, along with post-vaccine cellular assessments taken over 3 weeks. Results indicate that expansions in circulating T cells differ significantly between responders and nonresponders; demonstrating that those individuals developing greater cell proliferation present elevated levels of neutralizing antibodies directed against this specific pathogen compared to patients with weaker immune responses for whom no correlation is observed between polyclonal proliferation or increased antigenic desensitization influence on how much circulating antibody develops against H1N1 antigens presented on our trials about Monovalent Inactivated Vaccine (MIV). Altogether our results suggest that functional accounts for differences identified could explain why some respond better than others when vaccinated: variations regarding influencers pertaining directly immunity dynamic like age or inherent internomial factors are more likely associated in predicting their capacity of generating adequate protective responses thus improving personalized protocols based on patients data mapped onto consequential targets beneficially affecting populace health drastically reducing undesired side effects while still conserving efficacy rates successively advanced upon further research evidences registered and replicated properly enabling efficient large scale administration coverage upon emergencies periods conferring safety during critical moments by providing quick reliable answers secured within limits dictated by science applications",1
Recent developments in therapeutic protein expression technologies in plants,"

The aim of this paper is to discuss the efficiencies and advances in plant-based therapeutic protein expression technologies. This literature review will focus on recent developments in the field and how these improvements have enabled an increasing number of proteins to be expressed and puriﬁed from plants. Since its first demonstration in 1986, great progress has been made which includes techniques such as improved promoters, optimized codon usage, synthetic genes arraying whole libraries of recombinant proteins simultaneously from a single transgenic Event/Line etc. This article endeavors to reveal the processes that led up to identifying novel transforming methods for increased yield goals for commercialized product driven by current market demands due to continuously progressing medical requirements all over world We will also evaluate the existing bottlenecks associated with large scale production that may prevent successful application of these pathbreaking approaches during pharmaceutical drug development procedure.

Extracorporeal life support for management of refractory cardiac or respiratory failure: initial experience in a tertiary centre,"INTRODUCTION: Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) have been indicated as treatment for acute respiratory and/or cardiac failure. Here we describe our first year experience of in-hospital ECLS activity, the operative algorithm and the protocol for centralization of adult patients from district hospitals. METHODS: At a tertiary referral trauma center (Careggi Teaching Hospital, Florence, Italy), an ECLS program was developed from 2008 by the Emergency Department and Heart and Vessel Department ICUs. The ECLS team consists of an intensivist, a cardiac surgeon, a cardiologist and a perfusionist, all trained in ECLS technique. ECMO support was applied in case of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) not responsive to conventional treatments. The use of veno-arterial (V-A) ECLS for cardiac support was reserved for cases of cardiac shock refractory to standard treatment and cardiac arrests not responding to conventional resuscitation. RESULTS: A total of 21 patients were treated with ECLS during the first year of activity. Among them, 13 received ECMO for ARDS (5 H1N1-virus related), with a 62% survival. In one case of post-traumatic ARDS, V-A ECLS support permitted multiple organ donation after cerebral death was confirmed. Patients treated with V-A ECLS due to cardiogenic shock (N = 4) had a survival rate of 50%. No patients on V-A ECLS support after cardiac arrest survived (N = 4). CONCLUSIONS: In our centre, an ECLS Service was instituted over a relatively limited period of time. A strict collaboration between different specialists can be regarded as a key feature to efficiently implement the process.",0
The Model Repository of the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study,"The model repository (MREP) is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed under the auspices of models of infectious disease agent study (MIDAS). The purpose of the MREP is to organize and catalog the models, results, and suggestions for using the MIDAS and to store them in a way to allow users to run models from an access-controlled disease MREP. The MREP contains source and object code of disease models developed by infectious disease modelers and tested in a production environment. Different versions of models used to describe various aspects of the same disease are housed in the repository. Models are linked to their developers and different versions of the codes are tied to Subversion, a version control tool. An additional element of the MREP will be to house, manage, and control access to a disease model results warehouse, which consists of output generated by the models contained in the MREP. The result tables and files are linked to the version of the model and the input parameters that collectively generated the results. The result tables are warehoused in a relational database that permits them to be easily identified, categorized, and downloaded.",0
Local public health workers' perceptions toward responding to an influenza pandemic,"BACKGROUND: Current national preparedness plans require local health departments to play an integral role in responding to an influenza pandemic, a major public health threat that the World Health Organization has described as ""inevitable and possibly imminent"". To understand local public health workers' perceptions toward pandemic influenza response, we surveyed 308 employees at three health departments in Maryland from March – July 2005, on factors that may influence their ability and willingness to report to duty in such an event. RESULTS: The data suggest that nearly half of the local health department workers are likely not to report to duty during a pandemic. The stated likelihood of reporting to duty was significantly greater for clinical (Multivariate OR: 2.5; CI 1.3–4.7) than technical and support staff, and perception of the importance of one's role in the agency's overall response was the single most influential factor associated with willingness to report (Multivariate OR: 9.5; CI 4.6–19.9). CONCLUSION: The perceived risk among public health workers was shown to be associated with several factors peripheral to the actual hazard of this event. These risk perception modifiers and the knowledge gaps identified serve as barriers to pandemic influenza response and must be specifically addressed to enable effective local public health response to this significant threat.",0
Rapid Accumulation of Virulent Rift Valley Fever Virus in Mice from an Attenuated Virus Carrying a Single Nucleotide Substitution in the M RNA,"BACKGROUND: Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), a member of the genus Phlebovirus within the family Bunyaviridae, is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, while in livestock it causes fever and high abortion rates. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Sequence analysis showed that a wild-type RVFV ZH501 preparation consisted of two major viral subpopulations, with a single nucleotide heterogeneity at nucleotide 847 of M segment (M847); one had a G residue at M847 encoding glycine in a major viral envelope Gn protein, while the other carried A residue encoding glutamic acid at the corresponding site. Two ZH501-derived viruses, rZH501-M847-G and rZH501-M847-A, carried identical genomic sequences, except that the former and the latter had G and A, respectively, at M847 were recovered by using a reverse genetics system. Intraperitoneal inoculation of rZH501-M847-A into mice caused a rapid and efficient viral accumulation in the sera, livers, spleens, kidneys and brains, and killed most of the mice within 8 days, whereas rZH501-M847-G caused low viremia titers, did not replicate as efficiently as did rZH501-M847-A in these organs, and had attenuated virulence to mice. Remarkably, as early as 2 days postinfection with rZH501-M847-G, the viruses carrying A at M847 emerged and became the major virus population thereafter, while replicating viruses retained the input A residue at M847 in rZH501-M847-A-infected mice. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These data demonstrated that the single nucleotide substitution in the Gn protein substantially affected the RVFV mouse virulence and that a virus population carrying the virulent viral genotype quickly emerged and became the major viral population within a few days in mice that were inoculated with the attenuated virus.",0
Pandemic Influenza Planning in the United States from a Health Disparities Perspective,"We explored how different socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups in the United States might fare in an influenza pandemic on the basis of social factors that shape exposure, vulnerability to influenza virus, and timeliness and adequacy of treatment. We discuss policies that might differentially affect social groups’ risk for illness or death. Our purpose is not to establish the precise magnitude of disparities likely to occur; rather, it is to call attention to avoidable disparities that can be expected in the absence of systematic attention to differential social risks in pandemic preparedness plans. Policy makers at the federal, state, and local levels should consider potential sources of socioeconomic and racial/ethnic disparities during a pandemic and formulate specific plans to minimize these disparities.",0
A/T-rich sequences act as quantitative enhancers of gene expression in transgenic tobacco and potato plants,"

This study examines the role that A/T-rich sequences can have on gene expression in transgenic plants, focusing particularly on tobacco and potato plants. The scientific community has long been aware of the influence that these genomic motifs have had on transcriptional regulation in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms; however, a comprehensive analysis of their effects in plant genomes is largely lacking. Using established genetic transformation techniques, our research hopes to elucidate how A/T-rich sequences act as quantitative enhancers of gene expression when they are incorporated into transgenic tobacco and potato plants at various intervals. Furthermore, this research delves into how promoter activity, modification mechanisms (such as alternative splicing), and post-transcriptional control can interact to establish levels of gene expression in each plant species studied. By providing a comprehensive overview of how A/T-rich sequences may induce changes that affect an organism’s phenotype through epigenetic modifications, this paper will make significant strides toward understanding not only the importance but also the complex functions behind epigenetics within nature's diverse ecosystems.",1
Identification of a Conserved B-cell Epitope on Reticuloendotheliosis Virus Envelope Protein by Screening a Phage-displayed Random Peptide Library,"

This study investigates the identification of a conserved B-cell epitope on Reticuloendotheliosis Virus envelope protein by screening a phage-displayed random peptide library. Despite the evolution and emergence of new diseases, avian reticuloendotheliosis virus (REV) is still devastatingly prevalent in poultry production systems around the world. Moreover, understanding more about REV pathogenesis may be critical for improving animal health and biosecurity worldwide. In this report we demonstrate that a short 9 amino acid peptide derived from the TM4/C1 region of an REV gp85 envelope glycoprotein was identified as an immunodominant epitope when screened against a representative pseudo bird population via phage display technology, showing conservation across multiple genotypes. Our findings further advance our knowledge on potential target antigens for immune protection which could become applicable to vaccine development strategies aimed at REV infection control in birds.",1
"Production, Characterization and Applications for Toxoplasma gondii-Specific Polyclonal Chicken Egg Yolk Immunoglobulins","

This paper examines the production and characterization of polyclonal chicken egg yolk immunoglobulins specific to Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) with a focus on their potential applications in diagnosis, therapy and vaccination. Recent studies suggest that these polyclonal antibodies are an attractive alternative to monoclonal antibody-based products due to their relative affordability, broad range of epitopes recognized by large number of B cells and enhanced safety profiles when compared to small molecules or viral vectors-associated vaccines. Additionally, they have been used in several clinical trials involving humans without significant side effects reported so far. Here we present a comprehensive description of the process for producing these IgYs as well as physicochemical characterization based on aggregation tests and their application potential against T. gondii antigens from different strains presenting atypical forms including either non replicative or cyst states which could be implicated in drug resistance playing crucial role in veterinary clinics performances together with the food safety issues related by its presence into meat derived products.",1
Insertion/Deletion Polymorphism of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Gene in Kawasaki Disease,"Polymorphism of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is reported to be associated with ischemic heart disease, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy. In this study, we investigated the relationship between Kawasaki disease and insertion/deletion polymorphism of ACE gene. Fifty five Kawasaki disease patients and 43 healthy children were enrolled. ACE genotype was evaluated from each of the subjects' DNA fragments through polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Frequencies of ACE genotypes (DD, ID, II) were 12.7%, 60.0%, 27.3% in Kawasaki group, and 41.9%, 30.2%, 27.9% in control group respectively, indicating low rate of DD and high rate of ID genotype among Kawasaki patients (p<0.01). Comparing allelic (I, D) frequencies, I allele was more prevalent in Kawasaki group than in control group (57.3% vs. 43.0%, p<0.05). In Kawasaki group, both genotype and allelic frequencies were not statistically different between those with coronary dilatations and those without. ACE gene I/D polymorphism is thought to be associated with Kawasaki disease but not with the development of coronary dilatations.",0
Clinical factors associated with severity in hospitalized children infected with avian influenza (H5N1),"OBJECTIVE: The World Health organization received reports of 478 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (H5N1) from 15 countries between November 2003 and February 2010. More than 50% of these cases involved patients <20 years of age. Determining an association between the clinical factors at the time of hospital admission and prognosis may be useful for timely and adequate consultation and treatment. It has been difficult to obtain these clinical factors adjusted with other confounding factors, such as age and sex, as published studies of H5N1 virus infection usually reported only a few cases. So, we performed a pooled analysis of the reported cases. METHODS: Five case reports (36 patients <18 years of age) of H5N1 infection from four countries published between 2004 and 2009 were assessed based on available individual clinical data. Using the pooled data for all patients, we investigated the associations between patients’ prognosis and available laboratory findings, such as white blood cell (WBC) counts, platelet (PLT) counts, and serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) by adjusting for age and/or sex. RESULTS: The linear regression analysis revealed that mortality was negatively associated with WBC and PLT counts adjusted with age and sex. Increased log AST tended to be associated with a poor prognosis (p = 0.054), but there was no significant association between survival and log ALT level. CONCLUSIONS: Both decreased WBC and PLT counts can be considered to be common predictors of poor prognosis in H5N1 influenza patients <18 years of age. Further studies are needed for clarification.",0
Patterns and influencing factor of synonymous codon usage in porcine circovirus,"

The distributions of synonymous codon usage in living organisms play an essential role in the development of protein-coding genes. With the advent of next-generation sequencing technology, it is now possible to extensively analyze and characterize these patterns for various animal species, including swiftlet. This paper presents an exploration into the pattern and influencing factor of synonymous codon usage (SCU) in porcine circovirus (PCV). To this end, we analyzed all available complete genome sequences from three PCV genera using a chi-square test to determine which factors influence SCU; namely, GC content across different combinations between strands/orf. Our results provide insight into previously unexplored possibilities on how selection pressure may affect natural selection during gene recombination within PCV genomes. Additionally, our findings indicate a significant relationship between SCU composition and GC content with strand/orf combination factors having only a limited influence on individual amino acids’ overall patterns and trends. These results will further enable researchers to improve foundational knowledge concerning protein synthetase efficiency and replication adaptation strategies employed by viruses associated with pigs such as PCV2b that has posed an important global health concern due its acute infection lethality rate amongst swine animals even after vaccination efforts have been taken place conclusively for several years now",1
Combination strategies for pandemic influenza response - a systematic review of mathematical modeling studies,"BACKGROUND: Individual strategies in pandemic preparedness plans may not reduce the impact of an influenza pandemic. METHODS: We searched modeling publications through PubMed and associated references from 1990 to 30 September 2009. Inclusion criteria were modeling papers quantifying the effectiveness of combination strategies, both pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical. RESULTS: Nineteen modeling papers on combination strategies were selected. Four studies examined combination strategies on a global scale, 14 on single countries, and one on a small community. Stochastic individual-based modeling was used in nine studies, stochastic meta-population modeling in five, and deterministic compartmental modeling in another five. As part of combination strategies, vaccination was explored in eight studies, antiviral prophylaxis and/or treatment in 16, area or household quarantine in eight, case isolation in six, social distancing measures in 10 and air travel restriction in six studies. Two studies suggested a high probability of successful influenza epicenter containment with combination strategies under favorable conditions. During a pandemic, combination strategies delayed spread, reduced overall number of cases, and delayed and reduced peak attack rate more than individual strategies. Combination strategies remained effective at high reproductive numbers compared with single strategy. Global cooperative strategies, including redistribution of antiviral drugs, were effective in reducing the global impact and attack rates of pandemic influenza. CONCLUSION: Combination strategies increase the effectiveness of individual strategies. They include pharmaceutical (antiviral agents, antibiotics and vaccines) and non-pharmaceutical interventions (case isolation, quarantine, personal hygiene measures, social distancing and travel restriction). Local epidemiological and modeling studies are needed to validate efficacy and feasibility.",0
Mitigation Approaches to Combat the Flu Pandemic,"Management of flu pandemic is a perpetual challenge for the medical fraternity since time immemorial. Animal to human transmission has been observed thrice in the last century within an average range of 11-39 years of antigenic recycling. The recent outbreak of influenza A (H1N1, also termed as swine flu), first reported in Mexico on April 26, 2009, occurred in the forty first year since last reported flu pandemic (July 1968). Within less than 50 days, it has assumed pandemic proportions (phase VI) affecting over 76 countries with 163 deaths/35,928 cases (as on 15(th) June 2009). It indicated the re-emergence of genetically reassorted virus having strains endemic to humans, swine and avian (H5N1). The World Health Organisation (WHO) member states have already pulled up their socks and geared up to combat such criticalities. Earlier outbreaks of avian flu (H5N1) in different countries led WHO to develop pandemic preparedness strategies with national/regional plans on pandemic preparedness. Numerous factors related to climatic conditions, socio-economic strata, governance and sharing of information/logistics at all levels have been considered critical indicators in monitoring the dynamics of escalation towards a pandemic situation. The National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), Government of India, with the active cooperation of UN agencies and other stakeholders/experts has formulated a concept paper on role of nonhealth service providers during pandemics in April 2008 and released national guidelines - management of biological disasters in July 2008. These guidelines enumerate that the success of medical management endeavors like pharmaceutical (anti-viral Oseltamivir and Zanamivir therapies), nonpharmaceutical interventions and vaccination development etc., largely depends on level of resistance offered by mutagenic viral strain and rationale use of pharmaco therapeutic interventions. This article describes the mitigation approach to combat flu pandemic with its effective implementation at national, state and local levels.",0
The Problems with Forbidding Science,"

The purpose of this paper is to explore the issues with forbidding science in modern society. The study examines both the ethical and practical implications of such a policy. By doing so, it will provide evidence that while prohibiting scientific inquiry may appear on its surface to be a noble endeavor, in reality it has dire consequences for human progress and development. Furthermore, the research assesses how banning science impacts an individual’s ability to acquire knowledge through self-exploration or education channels. This paper also delves into various arguments for why prohibiting certain forms of scientific exploration goes against our better moral judgement and societal progress. Ultimately, it seeks to demonstrate the importance of allowing even controversial research topics profound consideration before making any decisions about their worthiness or value social contribution .

Virus Adaptation by Manipulation of Host's Gene Expression,"Viruses adapt to their hosts by evading defense mechanisms and taking over cellular metabolism for their own benefit. Alterations in cell metabolism as well as side-effects of antiviral responses contribute to symptoms development and virulence. Sometimes, a virus may spill over from its usual host species into a novel one, where usually will fail to successfully infect and further transmit to new host. However, in some cases, the virus transmits and persists after fixing beneficial mutations that allow for a better exploitation of the new host. This situation would represent a case for a new emerging virus. Here we report results from an evolution experiment in which a plant virus was allowed to infect and evolve on a naïve host. After 17 serial passages, the viral genome has accumulated only five changes, three of which were non-synonymous. An amino acid substitution in the viral VPg protein was responsible for the appearance of symptoms, whereas one substitution in the viral P3 protein the epistatically contributed to exacerbate severity. DNA microarray analyses show that the evolved and ancestral viruses affect the global patterns of host gene expression in radically different ways. A major difference is that genes involved in stress and pathogen response are not activated upon infection with the evolved virus, suggesting that selection has favored viral strategies to escape from host defenses.",0
Simian virus 40 vectors for pulmonary gene therapy,"BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains the leading cause of death in critically ill patients. One of the primary organs affected by sepsis is the lung, presenting as the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). Organ damage in sepsis involves an alteration in gene expression, making gene transfer a potential therapeutic modality. This work examines the feasibility of applying simian virus 40 (SV40) vectors for pulmonary gene therapy. METHODS: Sepsis-induced ARDS was established by cecal ligation double puncture (2CLP). SV40 vectors carrying the luciferase reporter gene (SV/luc) were administered intratracheally immediately after sepsis induction. Sham operated (SO) as well as 2CLP rats given intratracheal PBS or adenovirus expressing luciferase served as controls. Luc transduction was evaluated by in vivo light detection, immunoassay and luciferase mRNA detection by RT-PCR in tissue harvested from septic rats. Vector abundance and distribution into alveolar cells was evaluated using immunostaining for the SV40 VP1 capsid protein as well as by double staining for VP1 and for the surfactant protein C (proSP-C). Immunostaining for T-lymphocytes was used to evaluate the cellular immune response induced by the vector. RESULTS: Luc expression measured by in vivo light detection correlated with immunoassay from lung tissue harvested from the same rats. Moreover, our results showed vector presence in type II alveolar cells. The vector did not induce significant cellular immune response. CONCLUSION: In the present study we have demonstrated efficient uptake and expression of an SV40 vector in the lungs of animals with sepsis-induced ARDS. These vectors appear to be capable of in vivo transduction of alveolar type II cells and may thus become a future therapeutic tool.",0
Use of functional gene arrays for elucidating in situ biodegradation,"

This article examines the use of functional gene arrays for elucidating in situ biodegradation processes. Through a combination of geochemical modeling and genomic analysis, the potential to coarsely define how microbial communities respond to changing environmental conditions is investigated. The research systematically investigates the capability of functional gene arrays to identify key drivers that affect biodegradative pathways during field exposure to contaminants. Traditional techniques rely upon cultures and enrichment methods; these are labor-intensive and rarely account for uncultured organisms found in complex biogeochemical systems. The results suggest that functional genes can be used as reliable indicators for monitoring environmental change on a highly granular basis over a wide dynamic range through the application of microarray hybridization assays with taxon-independent probes which specifically target metabolic activities commonly associated with contaminant degradation. This article serves as an invaluable contribution towards describing a novel method which offers improved accuracy, spatial resolution, greater cost savings and shorter time frames relative to traditional methods employed within general biochemical process characterisation studies within polluted environments where access has been compromised by physical or chemical barriers",1
Differentially profiling the low-expression transcriptomes of human hepatoma using a novel SSH/microarray approach,"BACKGROUND: The main limitation in performing genome-wide gene-expression profiling is the assay of low-expression genes. Approaches with high throughput and high sensitivity for assaying low-expression transcripts are urgently needed for functional genomic studies. Combination of the suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) and cDNA microarray techniques using the subtracted cDNA clones as probes printed on chips has greatly improved the efficiency for fishing out the differentially expressed clones and has been used before. However, it remains tedious and inefficient sequencing works for identifying genes including the great number of redundancy in the subtracted amplicons, and sacrifices the original advantages of high sensitivity of SSH in profiling low-expression transcriptomes. RESULTS: We modified the previous combination of SSH and microarray methods by directly using the subtracted amplicons as targets to hybridize the pre-made cDNA microarrays (named as ""SSH/microarray""). mRNA prepared from three pairs of hepatoma and non-hepatoma liver tissues was subjected to the SSH/microarray assays, as well as directly to regular cDNA microarray assays for comparison. As compared to the original SSH and microarray combination assays, the modified SSH/microarray assays allowed for much easier inspection of the subtraction efficiency and identification of genes in the subtracted amplicons without tedious and inefficient sequencing work. On the other hand, 5015 of the 9376 genes originally filtered out by the regular cDNA microarray assays because of low expression became analyzable by the SSH/microarray assays. Moreover, the SSH/microarray assays detected about ten times more (701 vs. 69) HCC differentially expressed genes (at least a two-fold difference and P < 0.01), particularly for those with rare transcripts, than did the regular cDNA microarray assays. The differential expression was validated in 9 randomly selected genes in 18 pairs of hepatoma/non-hepatoma liver tissues using quantitative RT-PCR. The SSH/microarray approaches resulted in identifying many differentially expressed genes implicated in the regulation of cell cycle, cell death, signal transduction and cell morphogenesis, suggesting the involvement of multi-biological processes in hepato-carcinogenesis. CONCLUSION: The modified SSH/microarray approach is a simple but high-sensitive and high-efficient tool for differentially profiling the low-expression transcriptomes. It is most adequate for applying to functional genomic studies.",0
Generation of Human CEACAM1 Transgenic Mice and Binding of Neisseria Opa Protein to Their Neutrophils,"BACKGROUND: Human CEACAM1 is a cell-cell adhesion molecule with multiple functions including insulin clearance in the liver, vasculogenesis in endothelial cells, lumen formation in the mammary gland, and binding of certain human pathogens. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Three genomic BAC clones containing the human CEACAM1 gene were microinjected into pronuclei of fertilized FVB mouse oocytes. The embryos were implanted in the oviducts of pseudopregnant females and allowed to develop to term. DNA from newborn mice was evaluated by PCR for the presence of the human CEACAM1 gene. Feces of the PCR positive offspring screened for expression of human CEACAM1. Using this assay, one out of five PCR positive lines was positive for human CEACAM1 expression and showed stable transmission to the F1 generation with the expected transmission frequency (0.5) for heterozygotes. Liver, lung, intestine, kidney, mammary gland, and prostate were strongly positive for the dual expression of both murine and human CEACAM1 and mimic that seen in human tissue. Peripheral blood and bone marrow granulocytes stained strongly for human CEACAM1 and bound Neisseria Opa proteins similar to that in human neutrophils. CONCLUSION: These transgenic animals may serve as a model for the binding of human pathogens to human CEACAM1.",0
Identification of a new susceptibility variant for multiple sclerosis in OAS1 by population genetics analysis,"

This paper provides an evidence of the identification of a novel susceptibility variant in the gene OAS1 associated with multiple sclerosis by population genetics analysis. Through rigorous research, a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) has been discovered to show significant association between genetic and disease features, thus providing a quantitative insights into the pathogenesis and prognosis of this neurological disorder. 

Multiple sclerosis is one of the most commonly diagnosed conditions in young adults worldwide. Despite being increasingly understood through recent advances in neuroscience technology and clinical data, robust leaps that allow for predictions towards better diagnosis and treatment have remained elusive due to limited resources on genetic profiling investigations. This study sought to investigate any observable linkages between OAS1 variants and onset characteristics for multiple sclerosis using large-scale genomic datasets from public databases combined with statistical methods normally reserved for population genetics studies.  

The subsequent analyses successfully identified several predisposing loci demonstrating strong linkage disequilibrium including minor allele frequencies to previously reported variations at various known risk loci as well as introducing a susceptibility variant associated with MS where none had been previously noted - rs4444235 at chromosome 6p21 in gene OAS1 . Ultimately, our results suggest that rs4444235 acts as an important determinant modulating risk phenotypes for multiple sclerosis across different ethnic groups revealing extensive effects on near genes located within relevant functional pathways may provide further insight into disease progression such mechanisms may offer potential avenues therapeutic targets worth further investigation..",1
Preliminary Findings of a Randomized Trial of Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions to Prevent Influenza Transmission in Households,"BACKGROUND: There are sparse data on whether non-pharmaceutical interventions can reduce the spread of influenza. We implemented a study of the feasibility and efficacy of face masks and hand hygiene to reduce influenza transmission among Hong Kong household members. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial of households (composed of at least 3 members) where an index subject presented with influenza-like-illness of <48 hours duration. After influenza was confirmed in an index case by the QuickVue Influenza A+B rapid test, the household of the index subject was randomized to 1) control or 2) surgical face masks or 3) hand hygiene. Households were visited within 36 hours, and 3, 6 and 9 days later. Nose and throat swabs were collected from index subjects and all household contacts at each home visit and tested by viral culture. The primary outcome measure was laboratory culture confirmed influenza in a household contact; the secondary outcome was clinically diagnosed influenza (by self-reported symptoms). We randomized 198 households and completed follow up home visits in 128; the index cases in 122 of those households had laboratory-confirmed influenza. There were 21 household contacts with laboratory confirmed influenza corresponding to a secondary attack ratio of 6%. Clinical secondary attack ratios varied from 5% to 18% depending on case definitions. The laboratory-based or clinical secondary attack ratios did not significantly differ across the intervention arms. Adherence to interventions was variable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The secondary attack ratios were lower than anticipated, and lower than reported in other countries, perhaps due to differing patterns of susceptibility, lack of significant antigenic drift in circulating influenza virus strains recently, and/or issues related to the symptomatic recruitment design. Lessons learnt from this pilot have informed changes for the main study in 2008. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00425893 HKClinicalTrials.com HKCTR-365",0
The activity of the HIV-1 IRES is stimulated by oxidative stress and controlled by a negative regulatory element,"Initiation of translation of the full-length messenger RNA of HIV-1, which generates the viral structural proteins and enzymes, is cap-dependent but can also use an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) located in the 5′ untranslated region. Our aim was to define, through a mutational analysis, regions of HIV-1 IRES that are important for its activity. A dual-luciferase reporter construct where the Renilla luciferase (Rluc) translation is cap-dependent while the firefly luciferase (Fluc) translation depends on HIV-1 IRES was used. The Fluc/Rluc ratio was measured in lysates of Jurkat T cells transfected with the dual-luciferase plasmid bearing either the wild-type or a mutated IRES. Deletions or mutations in three regions decreased the IRES activity but deletion or mutations of a stem-loop preceding the primer binding site increased the IRES activity. The wild-type IRES activity, but not that of an IRES with a mutated stem-loop, was increased when cells were treated with agents that induce oxidative stress. Such stress is known to be caused by HIV-1 infection and we propose that this stem-loop is involved in a switch that stimulates the IRES activity in cells infected with HIV-1, supporting the suggestion that the IRES activity is up-regulated in the course of HIV-1 replication cycle.",0
Development of a Symptom Score for Clinical Studies to Identify Children With a Documented Viral Upper Respiratory Tract Infection,"The objective of this study was to develop a symptom scoring system for use in clinical studies that differentiates children with cold symptoms who have an identifiable viral etiology for their upper respiratory tract infection (URI) from those in whom no virus is detected. Nasal swabs for PCR testing for identification of respiratory viruses were obtained on children aged 2–11 y at baseline and when parents thought their child was developing a cold. Parental-recorded severity of specific symptoms in children with and without a documented viral URI were compared. Nasal swabs were obtained on 108 children whose parents reported their child was developing a cold. A viral etiology was identified in 62 of 108 (57.4%) samples. Symptom measures that best differentiated children with a viral etiology from those without were significant runny nose and significant cough on days 1–4 of the illness. A URI symptom score was developed based on these symptoms, with a sensitivity of 81.4%, specificity of 61.9%, and accuracy of 73.3%. Parental impression is only a moderately accurate predictor of viral URI in children. Our URI symptom score provided a more accurate method for identifying children with viral URIs for clinical studies.",0
Influenza Virus Respiratory Infection and Transmission Following Ocular Inoculation in Ferrets,"

This article examines the potential consequences of ocular inoculation with influenza virus in ferrets, particularly respiratory infection and transmission. Recent epidemiological data has indicated that pigs may be a primary vector of interspecies spread of influenza A viruses (IAV) between birds, humans and other animals. However, relatively little work has been done to elucidate how ocular routes allow for these infections to travel from one species to another. This study used ferrets as animal models for investigating whether this route could lead to both respiratory infection and subsequent transmission ability from an infected animal among their non-infected cohorts. The results demonstrate that IAV can effectively replicate following introduction into the nasal cavity or conjunctiva by aerosols or eye drops respectively in ferrets; leading quickly into significant symptoms akin to common human influenzas. Furthermore, there was evidence showing that such communication pathways are plausible modes for sustaining transmissibility at low but quantifiable rates within close-contact situations like those encountered by animal husbandry behaviors during normal farming practices..",1
IPS-1 Is Essential for the Control of West Nile Virus Infection and Immunity,"The innate immune response is essential for controlling West Nile virus (WNV) infection but how this response is propagated and regulates adaptive immunity in vivo are not defined. Herein, we show that IPS-1, the central adaptor protein to RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) signaling, is essential for triggering of innate immunity and for effective development and regulation of adaptive immunity against pathogenic WNV. IPS-1(−/−) mice exhibited increased susceptibility to WNV infection marked by enhanced viral replication and dissemination with early viral entry into the CNS. Infection of cultured bone-marrow (BM) derived dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages (Macs), and primary cortical neurons showed that the IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling was essential for triggering IFN defenses and controlling virus replication in these key target cells of infection. Intriguingly, infected IPS-1(−/−) mice displayed uncontrolled inflammation that included elevated systemic type I IFN, proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine responses, increased numbers of inflammatory DCs, enhanced humoral responses marked by complete loss of virus neutralization activity, and increased numbers of virus-specific CD8+ T cells and non-specific immune cell proliferation in the periphery and in the CNS. This uncontrolled inflammatory response was associated with a lack of regulatory T cell expansion that normally occurs during acute WNV infection. Thus, the enhanced inflammatory response in the absence of IPS-1 was coupled with a failure to protect against WNV infection. Our data define an innate/adaptive immune interface mediated through IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling that regulates the quantity, quality, and balance of the immune response to WNV infection.",0
Managing emerging infectious diseases: Is a federal system an impediment to effective laws?,"In the 1980's and 1990's HIV/AIDS was the emerging infectious disease. In 2003–2004 we saw the emergence of SARS, Avian influenza and Anthrax in a man made form used for bioterrorism. Emergency powers legislation in Australia is a patchwork of Commonwealth quarantine laws and State and Territory based emergency powers in public health legislation. It is time for a review of such legislation and time for consideration of the efficacy of such legislation from a country wide perspective in an age when we have to consider the possibility of mass outbreaks of communicable diseases which ignore jurisdictional boundaries.",0
Viral metagenomic analysis of bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) in Uganda identifies novel variants of Porcine parvovirus 4 and Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2,"

This study presents the findings of a novel analysis of bushpig (Potamochoerus larvatus) samples from Uganda, using metagenomics to sequence their complete viral components. Results show the presence of two recently identified viruses: Porcine parvovirus 4 and Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2. By identifying these novel variants in this African species, we provide preliminary evidence that they may be circulating naturally in bushpigs. We also discuss potential implications to animal health, while taking into account various biosecurity challenges posed by further emergence of new viruses in related regional species. The results herein demonstrate the utility of high-throughput sequencing methods for detecting cryptic viruses within wildlife populations, essential for comprehensive risk assessments and pathogen surveillance programs across Africa.",1
Production of high titre disabled infectious single cycle (DISC) HSV from a microcarrier culture,"

This paper presents a novel, cost-effective method for the high titre production of disabled infectious single cycle (DISC) Herpes Simplex Virus (HSV) from a microcarrier culture. We have developed a system that employs an optimized buffer and serum free media to enable significant increases in both yield and stability of DISC HSV from infected monolayer cells cultured on carriers, greatly improving its potential application in immunological applications. The advantages of this simple yet effective protocol are demonstrated in comparison with traditional methods, highlighting the benefit of our procedure when it comes to DISC HSV production.",1
Hepatitis C VLPs Delivered to Dendritic Cells by a TLR2 Targeting Lipopeptide Results in Enhanced Antibody and Cell-Mediated Responses,"

This journal article presents a study that investigates the capability of dendritic cells (DC) as an antigen-presenting cell to stimulate immune responses in murine models. The main objective was to assess the effectiveness of hepatitis C virus-like particles (HCV VLPs) delivered with a lipopeptide targeting toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2pep) for enhanced antibody and cellular immunity responses against HCV antigens. Using high throughput sequencing, it was observed that TLR2pep induced significantly higher immunogenicity compared to other adjuvant systems after four weeks of repeated intranasal administrations. Furthermore, binding assays revealed higher levels of soluble viral components in serum from mice treated with coated TLR2pep DC vaccine, indicating greater contribution from these cells for antigen presentation. Additionally, depending on administered doses there were increases not only in total antibodies but also IgG1/IgG2a populations when lower amounts of pep were used compared to traditional formulations with cholera toxin or poly I:C type 7 destabilizing complex. Results indicate that the co-administration protocol employed here proved beneficial over conventional methods leading towards successful induction levels suggesting its suitability before HCV vaccination moves on into clinical trials where such information would be critical for achieving successful outcomes.",1
Predictive Power of Air Travel and Socio-Economic Data for Early Pandemic Spread,"BACKGROUND: Controlling the pandemic spread of newly emerging diseases requires rapid, targeted allocation of limited resources among nations. Critical, early control steps would be greatly enhanced if the key risk factors can be identified that accurately predict early disease spread immediately after emergence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we examine the role of travel, trade, and national healthcare resources in predicting the emergence and initial spread of 2009 A/H1N1 influenza. We find that incorporating national healthcare resource data into our analyses allowed a much greater capacity to predict the international spread of this virus. In countries with lower healthcare resources, the reporting of 2009 A/H1N1 cases was significantly delayed, likely reflecting a lower capacity for testing and reporting, as well as other socio-political issues. We also report substantial international trade in live swine and poultry in the decade preceding the pandemic which may have contributed to the emergence and mixed genotype of this pandemic strain. However, the lack of knowledge of recent evolution of each H1N1 viral gene segment precludes the use of this approach to determine viral origins. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We conclude that strategies to prevent pandemic influenza virus emergence and spread in the future should include: 1) enhanced surveillance for strains resulting from reassortment in traded livestock; 2) rapid deployment of control measures in the initial spreading phase to countries where travel data predict the pathogen will reach and to countries where lower healthcare resources will likely cause delays in reporting. Our results highlight the benefits, for all parties, when higher income countries provide additional healthcare resources for lower income countries, particularly those that have high air traffic volumes. In particular, international authorities should prioritize aid to those poorest countries where both the risk of emerging infectious diseases and air traffic volume is highest. This strategy will result in earlier detection of pathogens and a reduction in the impact of future pandemics.",0
"Metagenomic Analysis of Fever, Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia Syndrome (FTLS) in Henan Province, China: Discovery of a New Bunyavirus","

The prevalence of unknown diseases is an increasing concern particularly in areas where overpopulation has led to poor basic provision such as healthcare. Fever, Thrombocytopenia and Leukopenia Syndrome (FTLS) was recently identified as one such disease in Henan Province, China; a region densely populated with rural villages lacking reliable medical access. To understand this newly reported syndrome, a metagenomic analysis was conducted on suspected subjects under the supervision of the National Research Center for Disease Control and Prevention (NRCCDP). This paper presents our results from this investigation into FTLS, including the discovery of a novel Bunyavirus whose genome sequencing revealed it to be closely related to other tick-borne viruses. Details are provided concerning the exact nature of FTLS's symptoms and their progression throughout different age groups between 2016-2019 within two provinces located in central-east China: Henan and Hebei. Utilising next generation sequencing technologies facilitated by 16S rRNA amplicon libraries prepared using our collaboration with Sillber LabTECH corp., we were able to identify genetic signatures associated with various pathogens from sputum samples collected from symptomatic participants during epidemiological surveys conducted at ground level local clinics. Additionally, molecular typing contributed evidence that linked FTLS correlates more strongly with Bunyaviridae species than those commonly carried by Hantavirus which had been originally hypothesised before empirical findings became available. Our comprehensive analyses have uncovered insights into both the cause and transmission dynamics driving this unique illness requiring thoughtful strategies to reduce its spread among vulnerable populations residing in medium density settlements across rural parts of Henan Province, China over time on an ongoing basis",1
First Dating of a Recombination Event in Mammalian Tick-Borne Flaviviruses,"

This paper elucidates on the first ever successful attempt at dating a crucial recombination event in mammalian tick-borne Flaviviruses. Using cutting edge technology, an experimental approach was carried out to determine when this phenomenon took place in both humans and animals. The results show that it had likely originated from several thousand years ago and persisted until now, cementing its status as a long standing area of study for scientists all over the world. This invaluable research can greatly contribute to our understanding of the importance of genetic diversity and evolution within related viruses, especially ones with significant medical implications for affected species.",1
An ontology for immune epitopes: application to the design of a broad scope database of immune reactivities,"BACKGROUND: Epitopes can be defined as the molecular structures bound by specific receptors, which are recognized during immune responses. The Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resource (IEDB) project will catalog and organize information regarding antibody and T cell epitopes from infectious pathogens, experimental antigens and self-antigens, with a priority on NIAID Category A-C pathogens () and emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases. Both intrinsic structural and phylogenetic features, as well as information relating to the interactions of the epitopes with the host's immune system will be catalogued. DESCRIPTION: To effectively represent and communicate the information related to immune epitopes, a formal ontology was developed. The semantics of the epitope domain and related concepts were captured as a hierarchy of classes, which represent the general and specialized relationships between the various concepts. A complete listing of classes and their properties can be found at . CONCLUSION: The IEDB's ontology is the first ontology specifically designed to capture both intrinsic chemical and biochemical information relating to immune epitopes with information relating to the interaction of these structures with molecules derived from the host immune system. We anticipate that the development of this type of ontology and associated databases will facilitate rigorous description of data related to immune epitopes, and might ultimately lead to completely new methods for describing and modeling immune responses.",0
Prevention of Cytotoxic T Cell Escape Using a Heteroclitic Subdominant Viral T Cell Determinant,"High affinity antigen-specific T cells play a critical role during protective immune responses. Epitope enhancement can elicit more potent T cell responses and can subsequently lead to a stronger memory pool; however, the molecular basis of such enhancement is unclear. We used the consensus peptide-binding motif for the Major Histocompatibility Complex molecule H-2K(b) to design a heteroclitic version of the mouse hepatitis virus-specific subdominant S598 determinant. We demonstrate that a single amino acid substitution at a secondary anchor residue (Q to Y at position 3) increased the stability of the engineered determinant in complex with H-2K(b). The structural basis for this enhanced stability was associated with local alterations in the pMHC conformation as a result of the Q to Y substitution. Recombinant viruses encoding this engineered determinant primed CTL responses that also reacted to the wildtype epitope with significantly higher functional avidity, and protected against selection of virus mutated at a second CTL determinant and consequent disease progression in persistently infected mice. Collectively, our findings provide a basis for the enhanced immunogenicity of an engineered determinant that will serve as a template for guiding the development of heteroclitic T cell determinants with applications in prevention of CTL escape in chronic viral infections as well as in tumor immunity.",0
Reading chest radiographs in the critically ill (Part II): Radiography of lung pathologies common in the ICU patient,This is part II of two series review of reading chest radiographs in the critically ill. Conventional chest radiography remains the cornerstone of day to day management of the critically ill occasionally supplemented by computed tomography or ultrasound for specific indications. In this second review we discuss radiographic findings of cardiopulmonary disorders common in the intensive care patient and suggest guidelines for interpretation based not only on imaging but also on the pathophysiology and clinical grounds.,0
Evolutionary Dynamics of the Interferon-Induced Transmembrane Gene Family in Vertebrates,"

This article presents a comprehensive overview of the evolutionary dynamics of the interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) gene family in vertebrates and discusses how these genes function as gatekeepers involved in antiviral defense. The IFITM gene family is comprised of six members including three human IFITMs, which are found mainly around mammals and birds. We provide evidence that this gene family has rapidly evolved during mammalian radiation to attain an increased resistance against viral infections while maintaining its ancestral characteristics and functions. Furthermore, we investigate various aspects related to the evolution of these genes such as genetic conservation or duplication events by focusing on their genomic organization and transcriptional patterns across different species. Our findings indicate that many protective roles have been acquired through mutation accumulation along time allowing IFITMs to efficiently counter pathogenic viruses. Collectively, our data reveal new insight into mechanisms governing diversification within this gene class, providing further support for the notion that at least some variation therein can aid adaptive host/pathogen interactions over millions of years of selection pressure from infection agents’ challenges.

Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 Bind Integrins and ACE2 Regulates Integrin Signalling,"

This study explores the interaction between proteins crucial in cardiovascular pathogenesis, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), ACE2 and integrins. The objective was to gain an understanding of how ACE2 binds to integrin molecules and furthermore, how this binding equates with a functional role regulating integrin signalling within human cells. To fulfil the aim, cultured cell lines expressing both the ACE-ACE2 complex and various integrins were compared in terms of receptor affinity as well as surface expression levels through FACS analysis. Subsequently, multiple types of experiments were conducted demonstrating that ACE2 has a critical function differentially maintaining molecular receptors expressed on cells’ surfaces by influencing their interactions with adaptor or scaffold proteins which are involved in transmitting signals from within the extracellular environment into intracellular pathways driving cell behaviours such as motility or migration. Overall, this work presents evidence for a novel link between two key regulators within cardiovascular homeostasis - those being necessarily present balance maintained by angiotensin hormones influenced by actions from distinctive inferential forms – resulting in new insights into likely determinants altered throughout disease processes such as atherosclerosis or hypertension manifestations.",1
Infectious Disease Transmission during Organ and Tissue Transplantation,"

This study examines the potential for transmission of infectious diseases during organ and tissue transplantation procedures. The incidence of donor-derived infection in solid organ transplant recipients has been documented as up to 5%, with a variety of infections reported including hepatitis, HIV, chlamydia, lyme disease and syphilis. However, given the complexity of the procedure and its associated risks, it remains to be seen how such transmissions are actually occurring. This investigation provides an overview of prevailing research into both preventative measures against communicable diseases transmitted by transplants during surgery as well as ways in which exposure can be detected prior to acquisition or transfer. Our findings serve to inform protocols concerning the actual timing of evaluation for recipient suitability and disposition among those awaiting donation or transplant organs and tissues within localized healthcare systems.",1
BUHO: A MATLAB Script for the Study of Stress Granules and Processing Bodies by High-Throughput Image Analysis,"

The field of cellular biology has undergone rapid changes due to the emergence of novel technologies and techniques that enable automated, high-throughput analysis at a large scale. This trend is no exception in the study of two major organelles found within cells – Stress Granules (SGs) and Processing Bodies (PBs). Herein, we present BUHO; a comprehensive MATLAB script for automatic, semi-automatic and manual evaluation of SGs and PBs via high throughput imaging. We review current methods for SG/PB research before detailing our own advanced workflow including preprocessing tools such as image registration, masking or segmentation options with various deep learning algorithms. Finally, we validate its performance on different datasets by measuring Spearman’s Correlation Coefficient to prove its effectiveness against earlier models over wide range of parameters like accuracy or simplicity. Our end goal is to provide an intuitive yet effective platform accessible to biologists everywhere so they can better analyze these enigmatic structures more accurately than ever before.",1
Oct-4 Expression Maintained Cancer Stem-Like Properties in Lung Cancer-Derived CD133-Positive Cells,"CD133 (prominin-1), a 5-transmembrane glycoprotein, has recently been considered to be an important marker that represents the subset population of cancer stem-like cells. Herein we report the isolation of CD133-positive cells (LC-CD133(+)) and CD133-negative cells (LC-CD133(−)) from tissue samples of ten patients with non-small cell lung cancer (LC) and five LC cell lines. LC-CD133(+) displayed higher Oct-4 expressions with the ability to self-renew and may represent a reservoir with proliferative potential for generating lung cancer cells. Furthermore, LC-CD133(+), unlike LC-CD133(−), highly co-expressed the multiple drug-resistant marker ABCG2 and showed significant resistance to chemotherapy agents (i.e., cisplatin, etoposide, doxorubicin, and paclitaxel) and radiotherapy. The treatment of Oct-4 siRNA with lentiviral vector can specifically block the capability of LC-CD133(+) to form spheres and can further facilitate LC-CD133(+) to differentiate into LC-CD133(−). In addition, knock-down of Oct-4 expression in LC-CD133(+) can significantly inhibit the abilities of tumor invasion and colony formation, and increase apoptotic activities of caspase 3 and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Finally, in vitro and in vivo studies further confirm that the treatment effect of chemoradiotherapy for LC-CD133(+) can be improved by the treatment of Oct-4 siRNA. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Oct-4 expression plays a crucial role in maintaining the self-renewing, cancer stem-like, and chemoradioresistant properties of LC-CD133(+). Future research is warranted regarding the up-regulated expression of Oct-4 in LC-CD133(+) and malignant lung cancer.",0
The early diversification of influenza A/H1N1pdm,"Background Since its initial detection in April 2009, the A/H1N1pdm influenza virus has spread rapidly in humans, with over 5,700 human deaths. However, little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of H1N1pdm and its geographic and temporal diversification. Methods Phylogenetic analysis was conducted upon the concatenated coding regions of whole-genome sequences from 290 H1N1pdm isolates sampled globally between April 1 – July 9, 2009, including relatively large samples from the US states of Wisconsin and New York. Results At least 7 phylogenetically distinct viral clades have disseminated globally and co-circulated in localities that experienced multiple introductions of H1N1pdm. The epidemics in New York and Wisconsin were dominated by two different clades, both phylogenetically distinct from the viruses first identified in California and Mexico, suggesting an important role for founder effects in determining local viral population structures. Conclusions Determining the global diversity of H1N1pdm is central to understanding the evolution and spatial spread of the current pandemic, and to predict its future impact on human populations. Our results indicate that H1N1pdm has already diversified into distinct viral lineages with defined spatial patterns.",0
Validation of Self-swab for Virologic Confirmation of Influenza Virus Infections in a Community Setting,"

This study examines the validity of self-swabbing technology used to clinically confirm influenza virus infections in an inhabited region. The study is based on a population sample from a community setting and utilizes conventional diagnostic methods as well as novel self-collected swab samples for comparison. Our results provide evidence for reliable validation of self-collection with nasopharyngeal swabs as an alternative physical sampling technique for optimising virologic confirmation of Influenza virus infection in a community environment.",1
Epithelial Cells Derived from Swine Bone Marrow Express Stem Cell Markers and Support Influenza Virus Replication In Vitro,"

This study investigates the potential of using animal sources as a means to develop more effective cell-based treatments for influenza. Epithelial cells derived from swine bone marrow, were assessed for stemness markers and tested in vitro for their ability to support flu virus replication. Results revealed that epithelial cells express key stem cell markers associated with pluripotency, indicating they potentially have regenerative properties and can serve as a source of distinct immunological pathways. Furthermore, the resulting data demonstrated that these particular epithelial cells could support robust influenza A/Texas/09 virus propagation compared to other cell types evaluated throughout the experiment. Thusly, this study represents an important step towards increasing knowledge on how animal-derived somatic cellular substitutes may be used to produce sufficient quantities of antiviral therapeutics efficiently against such viruses like influenza.",1
Human Bocaviruses Are Not Significantly Associated with Gastroenteritis: Results of Retesting Archive DNA from a Case Control Study in the UK,"

This study addresses the complex issue of whether or not human bocaviruses (HBoVs) are associated with gastroenteritis in humans. Using research from an archive DNA sample collected between 2002 and 2004 from a case control study conducted in the United Kingdom, this paper describes the results that lead to refuting this potential association. A novel statistical technique was used to compare data relative to HBoV prevalence among healthy individuals compared with those presenting symptoms consistent with gastroenteritis. The results of the retesting indicated no significant correlation between HBoV presence and gastrointestinal illness that could be accurately defined. Furthermore, other microbiological evidence obtained during the investigation added further support for lack of an existing link between HBoVs and disease processes within Gastrointestinal Tracts (GIT). This systematic analysis serves as a basis for concluding that there is insufficient evidence to obtain conclusive proof regarding any direct impact on human health as a result of exposure or infection by these particular bocaviral species",1
Protection of pulmonary epithelial cells from oxidative stress by hMYH adenine glycosylase,"BACKGROUND: Oxygen toxicity is a major cause of lung injury. The base excision repair pathway is one of the most important cellular protection mechanisms that responds to oxidative DNA damage. Lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes include hOgg1, hMYH, hNTH and hMTH. METHODS: The above lesion-specific DNA repair enzymes were expressed in human alveolar epithelial cells (A549) using the pSF91.1 retroviral vector. Cells were exposed to a 95% oxygen environment, ionizing radiation (IR), or H(2)O(2). Cell growth analysis was performed under non-toxic conditions. Western blot analysis was performed to verify over-expression and assess endogenous expression under toxic and non-toxic conditions. Statistical analysis was performed using the paired Student's t test with significance being accepted for p < 0.05. RESULTS: Cell killing assays demonstrated cells over-expressing hMYH had improved survival to both increased oxygen and IR. Cell growth analysis of A549 cells under non-toxic conditions revealed cells over-expressing hMYH also grow at a slower rate. Western blot analysis demonstrated over-expression of each individual gene and did not result in altered endogenous expression of the others. However, it was observed that O(2 )toxicity did lead to a reduced endogenous expression of hNTH in A549 cells. CONCLUSION: Increased expression of the DNA glycosylase repair enzyme hMYH in A549 cells exposed to O(2 )and IR leads to improvements in cell survival. DNA repair through the base excision repair pathway may provide an alternative way to offset the damaging effects of O(2 )and its metabolites.",0
Establishing a nationwide emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system for better public health responses in Taiwan,"BACKGROUND: With international concern over emerging infectious diseases (EID) and bioterrorist attacks, public health is being required to have early outbreak detection systems. A disease surveillance team was organized to establish a hospital emergency department-based syndromic surveillance system (ED-SSS) capable of automatically transmitting patient data electronically from the hospitals responsible for emergency care throughout the country to the Centers for Disease Control in Taiwan (Taiwan-CDC) starting March, 2004. This report describes the challenges and steps involved in developing ED-SSS and the timely information it provides to improve in public health decision-making. METHODS: Between June 2003 and March 2004, after comparing various surveillance systems used around the world and consulting with ED physicians, pediatricians and internal medicine physicians involved in infectious disease control, the Syndromic Surveillance Research Team in Taiwan worked with the Real-time Outbreak and Disease Surveillance (RODS) Laboratory at the University of Pittsburgh to create Taiwan's ED-SSS. The system was evaluated by analyzing daily electronic ED data received in real-time from the 189 hospitals participating in this system between April 1, 2004 and March 31, 2005. RESULTS: Taiwan's ED-SSS identified winter and summer spikes in two syndrome groups: influenza-like illnesses and respiratory syndrome illnesses, while total numbers of ED visits were significantly higher on weekends, national holidays and the days of Chinese lunar new year than weekdays (p < 0.001). It also identified increases in the upper, lower, and total gastrointestinal (GI) syndrome groups starting in November 2004 and two clear spikes in enterovirus-like infections coinciding with the two school semesters. Using ED-SSS for surveillance of influenza-like illnesses and enteroviruses-related infections has improved Taiwan's pandemic flu preparedness and disease control capabilities. CONCLUSION: Taiwan's ED-SSS represents the first nationwide real-time syndromic surveillance system ever established in Asia. The experiences reported herein can encourage other countries to develop their own surveillance systems. The system can be adapted to other cultural and language environments for better global surveillance of infectious diseases and international collaboration.",0
Mathematical Modeling of the Effectiveness of Facemasks in Reducing the Spread of Novel Influenza A (H1N1),"On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1) a pandemic. With limited supplies of antivirals and vaccines, countries and individuals are looking at other ways to reduce the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009, particularly options that are cost effective and relatively easy to implement. Recent experiences with the 2003 SARS and 2009 H1N1 epidemics have shown that people are willing to wear facemasks to protect themselves against infection; however, little research has been done to quantify the impact of using facemasks in reducing the spread of disease. We construct and analyze a mathematical model for a population in which some people wear facemasks during the pandemic and quantify impact of these masks on the spread of influenza. To estimate the parameter values used for the effectiveness of facemasks, we used available data from studies on N95 respirators and surgical facemasks. The results show that if N95 respirators are only 20% effective in reducing susceptibility and infectivity, only 10% of the population would have to wear them to reduce the number of influenza A (H1N1) cases by 20%.

Molecular and physiologic basis of quinoline drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum malaria,"30 years before the discovery of the pfcrt gene, altered cellular drug accumulation in drug-resistant malarial parasites had been well documented. Heme released from catabolized hemoglobin was thought to be a key target for quinoline drugs, and additional modifications to quinoline drug structure in order to improve activity against chloroquine-resistant malaria were performed in a few laboratories. However, parasite cell culture methods were still in their infancy, assays for drug susceptibility were not well standardized, and the power of malarial genetics was decades away. The last 10 years have witnessed explosive progress in elucidation of the biochemistry of chloroquine resistance. This review briefly summarizes that progress, and discusses where additional work is needed.",0
The impact of media coverage on the transmission dynamics of human influenza,"

This paper explores the impact of media coverage on the transmission dynamics of human influenza. Recent studies suggest a link between reported cases and negative headlines in news reports, while other research suggests that warnings issued by health authorities are more effective than reports by local or individual outlets in influencing public behavior and reducing spread. We analyze existing data from a variety of sources to compare their relative efficacy and identify areas for further study. Our findings suggest that certain types of media coverage can have significant effects on infection rates, providing valuable insight into how greater awareness and prevention strategies could reduce the global burden of influenza-related morbidity and mortality.",1
"Vulnerability, diversity and scarcity: on universal rights","

This research paper aims to explore the concept of universal rights, particularly in its application to three key elements: vulnerability, diversity and scarcity. By examining how these topics intersect with access to basic human needs such as food and water, this study seeks to understand how an understanding of universal rights can inform both policy makers and practitioners when responding to various aspects of society today. In doing so, it will attempt to illustrate the importance of protecting human dignity regardless of political dynamics or changing societal structures. Through a combination of qualitative analysis and empirical studies tending toward a common goal, we strive for a comprehensive response on securing protected universal rights across all communities worldwide.",1
Delivery of steric block morpholino oligomers by (R-X-R)(4) peptides: structure–activity studies,"Redirecting the splicing machinery through the hybridization of high affinity, RNase H- incompetent oligonucleotide analogs such as phosphoramidate morpholino oligonucleotides (PMO) might lead to important clinical applications. Chemical conjugation of PMO to arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides (CPP) such as (R-Ahx-R)(4) (with Ahx standing for 6-aminohexanoic acid) leads to sequence-specific splicing correction in the absence of endosomolytic agents in cell culture at variance with most conventional CPPs. Importantly, (R-Ahx-R)(4)–PMO conjugates are effective in mouse models of various viral infections and Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Unfortunately, active doses in some applications might be close to cytotoxic ones thus presenting challenge for systemic administration of the conjugates in those clinical settings. Structure–activity relationship studies have thus been undertaken to unravel CPP structural features important for the efficient nuclear delivery of the conjugated PMO and limiting steps in their internalization pathway. Affinity for heparin (taken as a model heparan sulfate), hydrophobicity, cellular uptake, intracellular distribution and splicing correction have been monitored. Spacing between the charges, hydrophobicity of the linker between the Arg-groups and Arg-stereochemistry influence splicing correction efficiency. A significant correlation between splicing correction efficiency, affinity for heparin and ability to destabilize model synthetic vesicles has been observed but no correlation with cellular uptake has been found. Efforts will have to focus on endosomal escape since it appears to remain the limiting factor for the delivery of these splice-redirecting ON analogs.",0
Nucleolus: the fascinating nuclear body,"Nucleoli are the prominent contrasted structures of the cell nucleus. In the nucleolus, ribosomal RNAs are synthesized, processed and assembled with ribosomal proteins. RNA polymerase I synthesizes the ribosomal RNAs and this activity is cell cycle regulated. The nucleolus reveals the functional organization of the nucleus in which the compartmentation of the different steps of ribosome biogenesis is observed whereas the nucleolar machineries are in permanent exchange with the nucleoplasm and other nuclear bodies. After mitosis, nucleolar assembly is a time and space regulated process controlled by the cell cycle. In addition, by generating a large volume in the nucleus with apparently no RNA polymerase II activity, the nucleolus creates a domain of retention/sequestration of molecules normally active outside the nucleolus. Viruses interact with the nucleolus and recruit nucleolar proteins to facilitate virus replication. The nucleolus is also a sensor of stress due to the redistribution of the ribosomal proteins in the nucleoplasm by nucleolus disruption. The nucleolus plays several crucial functions in the nucleus: in addition to its function as ribosome factory of the cells it is a multifunctional nuclear domain, and nucleolar activity is linked with several pathologies. Perspectives on the evolution of this research area are proposed.",0
A Co-Opted DEAD-Box RNA Helicase Enhances Tombusvirus Plus-Strand Synthesis,"

This paper examines the influence of a recently co-opted DEAD-Box RNA Helicase on Tombusvirus plus-strand synthesis. The discovery and characterization of this protein has enabled researchers to better understand the intricate mechanism by which positive strand Tombusviridae viruses replicate in infected host cells. Using an array of biochemical and molecular approaches, we have examined the ability of this helicase to act as an enhancer for efficient replication initiation - findings suggest it is responsible for preserving stem loop structure within viral RNA templates thereby assisting core replicase machinery recognition sites. Our data also showed that without expression from DEAD Box helicases, suboptimal tombusviral content was observed within even highly expressed positive strands; a trend that can be reversed in the presence of such proteins. These results firstly provide evidence that co-opted DEAD box helicases are functionally significant during virus infections but further signify their role on optimal plus strand accumulation –giving new insights into potential drug targets at early stages of infection.",1
Protective Role of the ACE2/Ang-(1–9) Axis in Cardiovascular Remodeling,"

This study investigates the involvement of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and Ang-(1–9) axis in protecting from cardiovascular remodeling during hypertension. In recent years, numerous studies have confirmed the role of these related molecules as key players in maintaining a healthy vascular structure and their potential for modulating physiological processes using small molecule therapeutics. As such, this work looks at the protective capacities of ACE2/Ang-(1–9) axis on changes to cardiac morphology due to hypertension, identifying specifically how they impede on negative changes while preserving necessary structures. Using various forms of quantification alongside a post-mortem analysis mechanism, this paper aims to better our understanding of how treatments targeting this axis can offer promise against conditions caused by powerful pressures placed upon highly intricate organs and systems such as those found within human cardiac tissue.",1
Molecular evidence for the evolution of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by symbiogenesis,"BACKGROUND: Female endoparasitic ichneumonid wasps inject virus-like particles into their caterpillar hosts to suppress immunity. These particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and resemble ascovirus virions, which are also transmitted by parasitic wasps and attack caterpillars. Ascoviruses replicate DNA and produce virions. Polydnavirus DNA consists of wasp DNA replicated by the wasp from its genome, which also directs particle synthesis. Structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. RESULTS: Here we show that a family of unique pox-D5 NTPase proteins in the Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus are related to three Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins encoded by ORFs 90, 91 and 93. A new alignment technique also shows that two proteins from a related ichnovirus are orthologs of other ascovirus virion proteins. CONCLUSION: Our results provide molecular evidence supporting the origin of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by lateral transfer of ascoviral genes into ichneumonid wasp genomes, perhaps the first example of symbiogenesis between large DNA viruses and eukaryotic organisms. We also discuss the limits of this evidence through complementary studies, which revealed that passive lateral transfer of viral genes among polydnaviral, bacterial, and wasp genomes may have occurred repeatedly through an intimate coupling of both recombination and replication of viral genomes during evolution. The impact of passive lateral transfers on evolutionary relationships between polydnaviruses and viruses with large double-stranded genomes is considered in the context of the theory of symbiogenesis.",0
Expression of the VP2 Protein of Murine Norovirus by a Translation Termination-Reinitiation Strategy,"BACKGROUND: Expression of the minor virion structural protein VP2 of the calicivirus murine norovirus (MNV) is believed to occur by the unusual mechanism of termination codon-dependent reinitiation of translation. In this process, following translation of an upstream open reading frame (ORF) and termination at the stop codon, a proportion of 40S subunits remain associated with the mRNA and reinitiate at the AUG of a downstream ORF, which is typically in close proximity. Consistent with this, the VP2 start codon (AUG) of MNV overlaps the stop codon of the upstream VP1 ORF (UAA) in the pentanucleotide UAA UG. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here, we confirm that MNV VP2 expression is regulated by termination-reinitiation and define the mRNA sequence requirements. Efficient reintiation is dependent upon 43 nt of RNA immediately upstream of the UAA UG site. Chemical and enzymatic probing revealed that the RNA in this region is not highly structured and includes an essential stretch of bases complementary to 18S rRNA helix 26 (Motif 1). The relative position of Motif 1 with respect to the UAA UG site impacts upon the efficiency of the process. Termination-reinitiation in MNV was also found to be relatively insensitive to the initiation inhibitor edeine. CONCLUSIONS: The termination-reinitiation signal of MNV most closely resembles that of influenza BM2. Similar to other viruses that use this strategy, base-pairing between mRNA and rRNA is likely to play a role in tethering the 40S subunit to the mRNA following termination at the VP1 stop codon. Our data also indicate that accurate recognition of the VP2 ORF AUG is not a pre-requisite for efficient reinitiation of translation in this system.",0
TcdC Does Not Significantly Repress Toxin Expression in Clostridium difficile 630ΔErm,"

This paper studies the potential role of tcdC, a repressor of toxin expression in C. difficile, on ΔErm mutant 630 strain. To assess the significance of this regulatory factor on the toxigenicity of C. difficile strains, we compared the toxigenic load profiles from gene expression data between parental and isogenic mutants strains containing wildtype (wt) or deleted (ΔtcdC) alleles at locus encoding for Toxins A/B-regulatory protein (TcpA/B). The results demonstrated that deletion of tcdC did not significantly decrease overall toxin production but marginally decreased essentiality index values associated with low oxacillin concentration treatments whereby transcriptional activation by ToxR was partially blocked by mutation within erm genes. Our results suggest that while tcdC may play a minor regulatory role in some experimental settings, it is unlikely to be involved as an intrinsic regulator in commandeering surface attached toxins produced during normal growth conditions in clinical isolates harbouring functional ermA and ermB genes such as those found in common epidemic clones often observed throughout hospitals worldwide carrying toxic bypassed mechanism(s).",1
Application of Consensus Scoring and Principal Component Analysis for Virtual Screening against β-Secretase (BACE-1),"

This paper presents results from a discovery application of consensus scoring, based on electrostatic potential derived spatial features and principal component analysis as applied to β-secretase (BACE-1) virtual screening. BACE-1 is an attractive drug target for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease due to its involvement in amyloid-β pathology. Truncation induced by BACE-1 cleavage releases amyloid peptide which aggregates into toxic oligomers leading to synaptic damage. The presented computational search method was designed to identify potent small molecules interacting with BACE-1 active site pockets and possessing inhibitory activity against it. A total of 143 million compounds were virtually screened utilizing two step workflow including an initial improved consensus sorting protocol followed by final PCA discriminative model building and external validation test set evaluation. Our primary findings include higher enrichment scores at 0% false positive rate than those obtained by using traditional single scoring functions stand alone indicating a greater probability of finding novel inhibitors while preserving quality standards in hit selection criteria evaluation.",1
"Differential Seroprevalence of Human Bocavirus Species 1-4 in Beijing, China","

Differential Seroprevalence of Human Bocavirus Species 1-4 in Beijing, China
Human bocaviruses (HBoV) are a small group of paramyxoviruses which typically infect the human respiratory tract and can cause mild to moderate lower respiratory infection. They were first reported in 2005 and since then, more than fifteen HBoVs have been identified worldwide. The seroprevalence of these viruses has not yet been adequately explored among different populations and regions. This study aimed at determining the differential seroprevalence of four major genotypes (species 1-4) that make up the three prevalent species groups globally among children aged 0-15 years living in Beijing, China. Following ELISA testing for IgG antibody levels against various HBoV antigens across 326 children from two districts within the city during 2017–2018 a total 59% seropositivity rate was found; 39%, 11%, 5% and 2% for species 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Overall results showed significantly higher prevalence rates for species 1 as compared to other species groups likely due to aforementioned particularity followed by a pattern gradually decreasing from species 1 towards further downstream minor variants like type 4 although this finding would require further research investigations into larger cohorts with improved interventions specifically designed directed toward vulnerable subgroups at higher risk based on specific genotype predilection profiles so as inform better vaccine implementation strategies in improve public healthcare delivery protocols overall  amongst those communities where incidental outbreaks may be recurrently seen throughout time course.[237 words]",1
Severe imported malaria in an intensive care unit: a review of 59 cases,"

Severe imported malaria is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in non-endemic regions. This paper provides a comprehensive review of 59 cases of severe imported malaria among patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2006 and April 2019. All the patients had traveled to their country or region which was endemic for Plasmodium falciparum, which is usually the species associated with severe clinical manifestations. The results showed that all deaths occurred in individuals with high parasitaemia, more than 10% haematocrit reduction, advanced age and central nervous system involvement. Although prompt diagnosis and appropriate treatment are always recommended after travel outside usual residence areas, this study findings suggest ICU admission should be considered when unexpected symptoms have been noticed even in minor travelers who present low/negative parasitaemia but compatible clinical picture as well as specific laboratory features such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Thus an early recognition by clinicians on any patient suffering from fever following trips abroad in endemic countries can not only improve prognosis but also initiate prompt diagnostic procedures towards successful management leading to reduced mortality from Severe Imported Malaria.",1
"Criminalizing Health-Related Behaviors Dangerous to Others? Disease Transmission, Transmission-Facilitation, and the Importance of Trust","

The advancement of public health is constantly at the forefront of legislative goals and societal debates due to its highly visible impact. While criminalizing behavior that is dangerous to physical health has become a focus worldwide, this paper will examine the complex relationship between actions aimed at halting disease transmission, their ability to actually facilitate transmission, and how trust can be detrimentally impacted in such a situation. Through examining existing case studies involving HIV/AIDS criminalization laws in countries around the world, implications on other crimes centered around public health behaviors could become more apparent as legislation evolves over time. This exploration into catastrophic outcomes potentially associated with attempting to contain public health issues using legal means should bring greater awareness on the importance placed upon trust building initiatives between those enacting immediate change measures and affected populations who must bear any consequences from them.",1
Case-based reported mortality associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection in the Netherlands: the 2009-2010 pandemic season versus the 2010-2011 influenza season,"

This study presents a systematic analysis of case-based reported mortality associated with laboratory-confirmed influenza A(H1N1) 2009 virus infection in the Netherlands during the pandemic season of 2009–2010 and the influenza season of 2010–2011. Using routinely collected surveillance data, we investigated national patterns and trends as well as characteristics associated with reported deaths. Our results showed considerable differences between both seasons with respect to mortality risk factors, disease severity and overall impact on public health. During the pandemic of 2009-2010 more deaths were observed in women compared to men (RR: 1.31; 95%CI: 1.03~1.66), while during the 2010/2011 season a reverse pattern was found (RR: 0.80; 95%CI: 0.64-0·98). Additionally, multiple comorbidities were significantly more often present among individuals who succumbed from an H1N1 infection in both seasons (p<0·001), whereas immune status differed only slightly between both cohorts [OR = 0·785, CI = (95%: 0·638 – -0·970)]. Our findings suggest that clear preventive strategies should be applied for vulnerable populations such as elderly people, pregnant women and those suffering from certain medical conditions during future influenza outbreaks or epidemics on a national level throughout Europe",1
First report of molecular identification of Cystoisospora suis in piglets with lethal diarrhea in Japan,"

This article presents the first evidence of molecular identification of Cystoisospora suis in piglets with lethal diarrhea in Japan. The research investigated a sample of veterinarians and their reported cases across 5 regions, and revealed that C. suis had been predominately causing a major outbreak among piglets associated with high mortality rates. Data from autopsy results confirmed that samples contained the species, as well as microbiological testings from tissue sampling which also showed 100% infection rate amongst the same group. By comprehensively examining both pathological findings, this report is able to provide further insight into the epidemiology of C. suis-associated diarrheal illness among piglets in the said country and can be used for more effective diagnosis, early detection and better management strategies for these types of diseases moving forward.",1
Development of a humanized monoclonal antibody with therapeutic potential against West Nile virus,"Neutralization of West Nile virus (WNV) in vivo correlates with the development of an antibody response against the viral envelope (E) protein. Using random mutagenesis and yeast surface display, we defined individual contact residues of 14 newly generated monoclonal antibodies against domain III of the WNV E protein. Monoclonal antibodies that strongly neutralized WNV localized to a surface patch on the lateral face of domain III. Convalescent antibodies from individuals who had recovered from WNV infection also detected this epitope. One monoclonal antibody, E16, neutralized 10 different strains in vitro, and showed therapeutic efficacy in mice, even when administered as a single dose 5 d after infection. A humanized version of E16 was generated that retained antigen specificity, avidity and neutralizing activity. In postexposure therapeutic trials in mice, a single dose of humanized E16 protected mice against WNV-induced mortality, and may therefore be a viable treatment option against WNV infection in humans. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nm1240) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",0
Modeling the Economic Impact of Pandemic Influenza: A Case Study in Turkey,"

This study examined the economic impact of pandemic influenza on Turkey, with a particular focus on how various public health strategies influence its spread. Using a computed general equilibrium (CGE) model, estimates of changes to gross domestic product (GDP), human capital stock and labor supply were made in response to varying levels of disease containment. The results suggest that additional investment into containment strategies could reduce mortality risk along with the long-term financial losses associated with it; bolstering healthcare resources such as testing capabilities and protective medical equipment may prove especially beneficial. This research demonstrates the utility of CGE modeling technique for understanding costs & benefits when faced with an unpredictable global phenomenon like a pandemic influenza outbreak.",1
Dating the time of viral subtype divergence,"Precise dating of viral subtype divergence enables researchers to correlate divergence with geographic and demographic occurrences. When historical data are absent (that is, the overwhelming majority), viral sequence sampling on a time scale commensurate with the rate of substitution permits the inference of the times of subtype divergence. Currently, researchers use two strategies to approach this task, both requiring strong conditions on the molecular clock assumption of substitution rate. As the underlying structure of the substitution rate process at the time of subtype divergence is not understood and likely highly variable, we present a simple method that estimates rates of substitution, and from there, times of divergence, without use of an assumed molecular clock. We accomplish this by blending estimates of the substitution rate for triplets of dated sequences where each sequence draws from a distinct viral subtype, providing a zeroth-order approximation for the rate between subtypes. As an example, we calculate the time of divergence for three genes among influenza subtypes A-H3N2 and B using subtype C as an outgroup. We show a time of divergence approximately 100 years ago, substantially more recent than previous estimates which range from 250 to 3800 years ago.",0
Application of Molecular Diagnostic Techniques for Viral Testing,"

This study focuses on the application of molecular diagnostic techniques for accurate and timely viral testing. Viral infections have become a major burden to public health worldwide, costing billions of dollars each year. As such, it is paramount that point-of-care solutions be employed in order to identify and diagnose viral activity early on. The utilization of next generation sequencing (NGS) coupled with gene expression profiling has revolutionized diagnostic procedures in recent years, enabling speedy detection at reduced costs compared with traditional methods. This paper explores the advantages offered by NGS technology as well as its implications for patient care management through a systematic review of various relevant studies presented since 2013. Moreover, this research will propose alternative approaches for effective medical response programs in clinical settings where diagnostics are not immediately available or accessible due to financial restrictions or other pertinent factors influencing global health considerations.",1
Animal models of acute lung injury,"Acute lung injury in humans is characterized histopathologically by neutrophilic alveolitis, injury of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium, hyaline membrane formation, and microvascular thrombi. Different animal models of experimental lung injury have been used to investigate mechanisms of lung injury. Most are based on reproducing in animals known risk factors for ARDS, such as sepsis, lipid embolism secondary to bone fracture, acid aspiration, ischemia-reperfusion of pulmonary or distal vascular beds, and other clinical risks. However, none of these models fully reproduces the features of human lung injury. The goal of this review is to summarize the strengths and weaknesses of existing models of lung injury. We review the specific features of human ARDS that should be modeled in experimental lung injury and then discuss specific characteristics of animal species that may affect the pulmonary host response to noxious stimuli. We emphasize those models of lung injury that are based on reproducing risk factors for human ARDS in animals and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each model and the extent to which each model reproduces human ARDS. The present review will help guide investigators in the design and interpretation of animal studies of acute lung injury.",0
Logistics of community smallpox control through contact tracing and ring vaccination: a stochastic network model,"BACKGROUND: Previous smallpox ring vaccination models based on contact tracing over a network suggest that ring vaccination would be effective, but have not explicitly included response logistics and limited numbers of vaccinators. METHODS: We developed a continuous-time stochastic simulation of smallpox transmission, including network structure, post-exposure vaccination, vaccination of contacts of contacts, limited response capacity, heterogeneity in symptoms and infectiousness, vaccination prior to the discontinuation of routine vaccination, more rapid diagnosis due to public awareness, surveillance of asymptomatic contacts, and isolation of cases. RESULTS: We found that even in cases of very rapidly spreading smallpox, ring vaccination (when coupled with surveillance) is sufficient in most cases to eliminate smallpox quickly, assuming that 95% of household contacts are traced, 80% of workplace or social contacts are traced, and no casual contacts are traced, and that in most cases the ability to trace 1–5 individuals per day per index case is sufficient. If smallpox is assumed to be transmitted very quickly to contacts, it may at times escape containment by ring vaccination, but could be controlled in these circumstances by mass vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Small introductions of smallpox are likely to be easily contained by ring vaccination, provided contact tracing is feasible. Uncertainties in the nature of bioterrorist smallpox (infectiousness, vaccine efficacy) support continued planning for ring vaccination as well as mass vaccination. If initiated, ring vaccination should be conducted without delays in vaccination, should include contacts of contacts (whenever there is sufficient capacity) and should be accompanied by increased public awareness and surveillance.",0
"Characterization of Neutralizing Profiles in HIV-1 Infected Patients from whom the HJ16, HGN194 and HK20 mAbs were Obtained","

This article introduces the characterization of neutralizing profiles in HIV-1 infected patients from whom monoclonal antibodies such as HJ16, HGN194 and HK20 have been obtained. The purpose of this study is to explore the therapeutic activities of these mAbs against Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Analyses performed on serum samples collected from three individuals included tests for sensitivity to agonists and antagonists, testing for epitope binding motifs using CD4+, CCR5+ receptor binding analysis. Through a combination of techniques including quantitative viruses production assays, antigenic cross reactivity measurements, correlation studies between ligand-receptor target sites and virus vulnerability profiles were established for all three types of mAbs. Results indicated that each antibody had different mechanisms for blocking HIV infection as well as varying levels of viral intracellular penetration capabilities. Furthermore, an in vitro model system combining yeast immunosequencing technology with bioluminescence signal transduction was used to directly observe real time changes in the strength and magnitude ratio between replication inhibition among various antigens after exposure to specific concentrations conditions allowing us to further establish individualized therapeutic strategies based on patient's serology characteristics by linking immune responses associated with susceptible or resistant cellular strain phenotypes across multiple cells lines within a single experiment format. Overall our findings suggest that host genetics may be playing an important role influencing efficacy rates observed when used in vivo treatments settings indicating caution towards potential off target effects when selecting treatment regimens personalized according population variability concerns which must be addressed through sustainable supportive monitoring post clinical interventions procedure setting systems..

Epicatechins Purified from Green Tea (Camellia sinensis) Differentially Suppress Growth of Gender-Dependent Human Cancer Cell Lines,"The anticancer potential of catechins derived from green tea is not well understood, in part because catechin-related growth suppression and/or apoptosis appears to vary with the type and stage of malignancy as well as with the type of catechin. This in vitro study examined the biological effects of epicatechin (EC), epigallocatechin (EGC), EC 3-gallate (ECG) and EGC 3-gallate (EGCG) in cell lines from human gender-specific cancers. Cell lines developed from organ-confined (HH870) and metastatic (DU145) prostate cancer, and from moderately (HH450) and poorly differentiated (HH639) epithelial ovarian cancer were grown with or without EC, EGC, ECG or EGCG. When untreated cells reached confluency, viability and doubling time were measured for treated and untreated cells. Whereas EC treatment reduced proliferation of HH639 cells by 50%, EGCG suppressed proliferation of all cell lines by 50%. ECG was even more potent: it inhibited DU145, HH870, HH450 and HH639 cells at concentrations of 24, 27, 29 and 30 µM, whereas EGCG inhibited DU145, HH870, HH450 and HH639 cells at concentrations 89, 45, 62 and 42 µM. When compared with EGCG, ECG more effectively suppresses the growth of prostate cancer and epithelial ovarian cancer cell lines derived from tumors of patients with different stages of disease.",0
Ebola Virus in West Africa: Waiting for the Owl of Minerva,"

The Ebola virus in West Africa has been a major concern for public health since its outbreak in 2014. This paper outlines the steps taken by the World Health Organization, government aid programs and local initiatives to contain and treat this deadly disease. The study also discusses how cultural beliefs, political instability and inadequate resources add complexity to controlling the situation. Through an analysis of both quantitative data, such as treatment numbers, mortality rates and quarantine results, as well as qualitative data focussed on understanding how individuals perceive their circumstances related to Ebola prevention efforts, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current status of this crisis. We conclude that while some progress has been made so far, only time will tell if these measures prove effective or whether we must look within ourselves for our salvation through careful consideration of social dynamics - waiting for the Owl of Minerva.",1
Treatment of acute bronchitis in adults without underlying lung disease,"

This article presents an innovative study on the treatment of acute bronchitis in adults without underlying lung disease. Acute bronchitis is a commonlower respiratory infection with mortality rates as high as 12%. Despite extensive research, treatments are inadequate and adverse effects remain concerning. The aim of this study was to evaluate a novel therapeutic regimen for treating adult patients with acute bronchitis, examining parameters such as symptom duration, degree of pneumonic infiltration, presenting sputum scores and general health-related quality of life measures. A total of 80 participants were recruited from 3 different clinical facilities and assigned either to the control or the experimental group; outcomes were analyzed through descriptive statistics. Results indicate that after 13 days from diagnosing acute bronchitis, no significant differences emerged in terms of pneumonic infiltrate assessment among groups, although shorter mean time for symptom resolution (4 vs 7 days) with medium effect size was identified in the experimental group compared to controls. Moreover, promising data concerning improvement in overall health related quality of life ratings observed only amongst treatment subjects hints at potential effectiveness for novel interventions . The implications generated by these results set grounds for further consolidation regarding efficacious outcomes associated with recommended management strategies for patients affected by this condition.",1
Geographic Distribution and Risk Factors of the Initial Adult Hospitalized Cases of 2009 Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Virus Infection in Mainland China,"

Despite the emergence of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus in Mainland China and its subsequent rapid geographic spread, there has been limited research into the distribution pattern of this newly emerged infection, as well as risk factors influencing adult hospitalized cases at an initial stage. In order to investigate these issues, a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted focusing on mainland China between May 1st and October 31st, 2009. A total sample size of 1202 guests were recruited from 20 provinces across the country. Data on their demographics characteristics, health status prior to influenza acquisition ,and economic development level were collected and analyzed statistically by Chi Square test. The results revealed that adult hospitalization rate significantly varied according to geographical location with highest rate occurring in Northeast China followed by North and then central regions respectively. Gender disproportionality (male:female=2:1) was found among all age groups except for elderly people (>60 years). People lower socio-economic backgrounds increased their susceptibility 5 folds while people who lived in rural area had higher acute hospitalization than those from urban areas with OR 3.03(95% CI 2.40–3.85). These findings provide valuable insights when designing specific national interventions for managing H1N1 infection dynamically throughout mainland China during outbreak seasons or similar sudden public influenza health challenges elsewhere in future .",1

Title: Demyelination and Remyelination in the Dorsal Funiculus of the Rat Spinal Cord after Heat Injury
This paper investigates how heat injury affects demyelination and remyelination in the dorsal funiculus of rat spinal cord. The research design comprises morphological examination and immunofluorescence staining, targeting myelin basic protein (MBP) to determine any changes that occur in this region due to thermal trauma. Preceding study on neuronal-glial interactions has revealed an intrinsic potential for repair processes; however, its timing and course remain unclear. For further understanding of functional recovery mechanisms after tissue damage, there is a need to explore remyelination process at different stages in various pathologies relevant roles played by glia cells have been speculated. Therefore, using longitudinal studies related to heat injured rats could provide knowledge about determining background events enabling or inhibiting nervous system self-repair processes even without additional treatment intervention. Collectively, it may help reveal new therapeutic approaches leading towards clinical cure from such traumatic conditions not only limited to burn patients only but pertainable also with other injury scenarios damaged nerves suffer from including eperimental models of diabetic neuropathy foundation for future investigation regarding motor function improvements on chronic progression cases could be laid down as well., overall objective includes evaluating opportunities available due treatment optimization where paralysis, loss off sensation or impaired synaptic transfer are present impairments resultant effects caused by reduced insulation capacity wound axons possess after primary disruption myelin sheath covering them....",1
Role of glutathione in immunity and inflammation in the lung,"Reactive oxygen species and thiol antioxidants, including glutathione (GSH), regulate innate immunity at various levels. This review outlines the redox-sensitive steps of the cellular mechanisms implicated in inflammation and host defense against infection, and describes how GSH is not only important as an antioxidant but also as a signaling molecule. There is an extensive literature of the role of GSH in immunity. Most reviews are biased by an oversimplified picture where “bad” free radicals cause all sorts of diseases and “good” antioxidants protect from them and prevent oxidative stress. While this may be the case in certain fields (eg, toxicology), the role of thiols (the topic of this review) in immunity certainly requires wearing scientist’s goggles and being prepared to accept a more complex picture. This review aims at describing the role of GSH in the lung in the context of immunity and inflammation. The first part summarizes the history and basic concepts of this picture. The second part focuses on GSH metabolism/levels in pathology, the third on the role of GSH in innate immunity and inflammation, and the fourth gives 4 examples describing the importance of GSH in the response to infections.",0
The infection of primary avian tracheal epithelial cells with infectious bronchitis virus,"Here we introduce a culture system for the isolation, passaging and amplification of avian tracheal epithelial (ATE) cells. The ATE medium, which contains chicken embryo extract and fetal bovine serum, supports the growth of ciliated cells, goblet cells and basal cells from chicken tracheas on fibronectin- or matrigel-coated dishes. Non-epithelial cells make up less than 10% of the total population. We further show that ATE cells support the replication and spread of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Interestingly, immunocytostaining revealed that basal cells are resistant to IBV infection. We also demonstrate that glycosaminoglycan had no effect on infection of the cells by IBV. Taken together, these findings suggest that primary ATE cells provide a novel cell culture system for the amplification of IBV and the in vitro characterization of viral cytopathogenesis.",0
Oligonucleotide Based Magnetic Bead Capture of Onchocerca volvulus DNA for PCR Pool Screening of Vector Black Flies,"

This article describes an investigation into the capture of Onchocerca volvulus DNA using oligonucleotide-coated magnetic beads and subsequent PCR pool screening of vector black flies. The problem tackled in this study is on how to screen vector black fly species quickly, accurately, and sensitively for O. volvulus infection as a tool to monitor transmission status of human onchocerciasis - a skin disease caused by parasitic nematodes – in endemic areas. Using a 16S ribosomal gene primer set targeting O. volvulusspecific molecules immobilized onto streptavidin-coated superparamagnetic Dynabeads M280, the precise amounts of target putative O. volvulus sequences are captured from different sample pools such as genetically diverse adult or larval field-collected specimens from multiple chorionic sites. A novel approach was developed allowing quick PCR pool screening with improved specificity due to higher sequencing accuracy at lower concentration levels obtained through pre-PCR selective bead capture process prior to direct nested PCR amplification step; thus clearing concerns associated with limited sample size issues during analysis. Results showed that method had comparable sensitivity when compared to conventional plasmid cloning−PCR approaches while being significantly faster1–2 orders of magnitude than those established molecular diagnosis systems currently used across endemic regions worldwide",1
"Schmallenberg Virus Pathogenesis, Tropism and Interaction with the Innate Immune System of the Host","

Schmallenberg virus (SBV) is a vector-borne zoonotic pathogen belonging to the family Bunyaviridae which has caused major economic losses in livestock production within Europe since its emergence in 2011. SBV infection is generally asymptomatic, however it can cause severe congenital defects and obstetrical problems in cattle, sheep and goats during outbreak periods. The aim of this study was to characterize the pathogenesis of Schmallenberg virus, its tropism and mechanism of interaction with the innate immune system of susceptible hosts. High throughput sequencing techniques were utilized to examine viral replication kinetics and assess the effect on host transcriptional responses involved in regulating inflammatory response pathways. Furthermore, recent scientific developments regarding reagents for analysis of differentially expressed genes through qPCR and immunofluorescence microscopy were employed for further evaluation using a 24 hour experimental model with 50% infectious dose (ID50). Results obtained may provide key insight into virus coordination between cell entry/exit points, tropism development as well as recognition events that take place during SBV emergence-provoking stages by the host media’s complement system thus leading towards optimization strategies tailored against future outbreaks.",1
Small Interfering RNA Targeting M2 Gene Induces Effective and Long Term Inhibition of Influenza A Virus Replication,"RNA interference (RNAi) provides a powerful new means to inhibit viral infection specifically. However, the selection of siRNA-resistant viruses is a major concern in the use of RNAi as antiviral therapeutics. In this study, we conducted a lentiviral vector with a H1-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) expression cassette to deliver small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) into mammalian cells. Using this vector that also expresses enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) as surrogate marker, stable shRNA-expressing cell lines were successfully established and the inhibition efficiencies of rationally designed siRNAs targeting to conserved regions of influenza A virus genome were assessed. The results showed that a siRNA targeting influenza M2 gene (siM2) potently inhibited viral replication. The siM2 was not only effective for H1N1 virus but also for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1. In addition to its M2 inhibition, the siM2 also inhibited NP mRNA accumulation and protein expression. A long term inhibition effect of the siM2 was demonstrated and the emergence of siRNA-resistant mutants in influenza quasispecies was not observed. Taken together, our study suggested that M2 gene might be an optimal RNAi target for antiviral therapy. These findings provide useful information for the development of RNAi-based prophylaxis and therapy for human influenza virus infection.",0
Torsional restraint: a new twist on frameshifting pseudoknots,"mRNA pseudoknots have a stimulatory function in programmed −1 ribosomal frameshifting (−1 PRF). Though we previously presented a model for how mRNA pseudoknots might activate the mechanism for −1 PRF, it did not address the question of the role that they may play in positioning the mRNA relative to the ribosome in this process [E. P. Plant, K. L. M. Jacobs, J. W. Harger, A. Meskauskas, J. L. Jacobs, J. L. Baxter, A. N. Petrov and J. D. Dinman (2003) RNA, 9, 168–174]. A separate ‘torsional restraint’ model suggests that mRNA pseudoknots act to increase the fraction of ribosomes directed to pause with the upstream heptameric slippery site positioned at the ribosome's A- and P-decoding sites [J. D. Dinman (1995) Yeast, 11, 1115–1127]. Here, experiments using a series of ‘pseudo-pseudoknots’ having different degrees of rotational freedom were used to test this model. The results of this study support the mechanistic hypothesis that −1 ribosomal frameshifting is enhanced by torsional resistance of the mRNA pseudoknot.",0
"Frequency of group A rotavirus in diarrhoeic calves in Brazilian cattle herds, 1998–2002"," 

""Frequency of group A rotavirus in diarrhoeic calves in Brazilian cattle herds, 1998–2002"": This retrospective study aimed to investigate the prevalence of Group A Rotavirus (GAR) infections among diarrhetic calves from Brazilian cattle herds over a five year period. Using nine published epidemiologic reports, analysis was conducted for 1124 calf specimens collected between 1998 and 2002 from 28 states. Results demonstrated that GAR accounted for 26% of all sampled specimens, with marked variation between years and regions. In summary, this study exhibits an overall high rate of GAR infection amongst vaccinated and unvaccinated juvenile bovine animals throughout Brazil during the study period. The findings suggest important implications for the development of effective control strategies against such serious illnesses in domestic livestock production systems worldwide.",1
"The Tennessee Children's Respiratory Initiative: Objectives, design and recruitment results of a prospective cohort study investigating infant viral respiratory illness and the development of asthma and allergic diseases","Background and objective: The ‘attack rate’ of asthma following viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) is about 3–4 fold higher than that of the general population; however, the majority of children who develop viral LRTI during infancy do not develop asthma, and asthma incidence has been observed to continuously decrease with age. Thus, we do not understand how viral LRTI either predispose or serve as a marker of children to develop asthma. The Tennessee Children's Respiratory Initiative has been established as a longitudinal prospective investigation of infants and their biological mothers. The primary goals are to investigate both the acute and the long‐term health consequences of varying severity and aetiology of clinically significant viral respiratory tract infections on early childhood outcomes. Methods: Over four respiratory viral seasons, 2004–2008, term, non‐low birth weight previously healthy infants and their biological mothers were enrolled during an infant's acute viral respiratory illness. Longitudinal follow up to age 6 years is ongoing. Results: This report describes the study objectives, design and recruitment results of the over 650 families enrolled in this longitudinal investigation. The Tennessee Children's Respiratory Initiative is additionally unique because it is designed in parallel with a large retrospective birth cohort of over 95 000 mother–infant dyads with similar objectives to investigate the role of respiratory viral infection severity and aetiology in the development of asthma. Conclusions: Future reports from this cohort will help to clarify the complex relationship between infant respiratory viral infection severity, aetiology, atopic predisposition and the subsequent development of early childhood asthma and atopic diseases.",0
Neutralizing immunogenicity of transgenic carrot (Daucus carota L.)-derived measles virus hemagglutinin,"

This journal article explores the effects of neutralizing immunogenicity when using transgenic carrots (Daucus carota L.) derived with measles virus hemagglutinin (MVH). Using a reverse genetics approach and animal models, researchers conduct an expats evaluation to elucidate the potential use of such plants as novel vaccine delivery systems. The findings support that plant-based vaccines offer promising prospects for future vaccine development due to their safety, cost–effectiveness and versatility. Furthermore, there is evidence that suggests MVH expressed in transgenic carrots can stimulate strong humoral immunity compared to other traditional methods and their expression profiles indicates characteristics amenable to further modifications for antigen quality improvement. Additionally, results indicate that manipulation of induction conditions may prove useful in furthering the capacity of these vaccines both effectively mitigating immunological responses or even enhancing them depending on required goals. Thus it is concluded that transgenic carrot-derived MVH are capable immune inducing entities which suggest long lasting impactful implications regarding vaccine efficacy in humans by improving antigen design strategies and delivery mechanisms",1
Hospital Triage System for Adult Patients Using an Influenza-Like Illness Scoring System during the 2009 Pandemic—Mexico,"BACKGROUND: Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged during 2009. To help clinicians triage adults with acute respiratory illness, a scoring system for influenza-like illness (ILI) was implemented at Hospital Civil de Guadalajara, Mexico. METHODS: A medical history, laboratory and radiology results were collected on emergency room (ER) patients with acute respiratory illness to calculate an ILI-score. Patients were evaluated for admission by their ILI-score and clinicians' assessment of risk for developing complications. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from intermediate and high-risk patients for influenza testing by RT-PCR. The disposition and ILI-score of those oseltamivir-treated versus untreated, clinical characteristics of 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) patients versus test-negative patients were compared by Pearson's Χ(2), Fisher's Exact, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. RESULTS: Of 1840 ER patients, 230 were initially hospitalized (mean ILI-score = 15), and the rest were discharged, including 286 ambulatory patients given oseltamivir (median ILI-score = 11), and 1324 untreated (median ILI-score = 5). Fourteen (1%) untreated patients returned, and 3 were hospitalized on oseltamivir (median ILI-score = 19). Of 371 patients tested by RT-PCR, 104 (28%) had pandemic influenza and 42 (11%) had seasonal influenza A detected. Twenty (91%) of 22 imaged hospitalized pandemic influenza patients had bilateral infiltrates compared to 23 (38%) of 61 imaged hospital test-negative patients (p<0.001). One patient with confirmed pandemic influenza presented 6 days after symptom onset, required mechanical ventilation, and died. CONCLUSIONS: The triaging system that used an ILI-score complimented clinicians' judgment of who needed oseltamivir and inpatient care and helped hospital staff manage a surge in demand for services.",0
VirHostNet: a knowledge base for the management and the analysis of proteome-wide virus–host interaction networks,"Infectious diseases caused by viral agents kill millions of people every year. The improvement of prevention and treatment of viral infections and their associated diseases remains one of the main public health challenges. Towards this goal, deciphering virus–host molecular interactions opens new perspectives to understand the biology of infection and for the design of new antiviral strategies. Indeed, modelling of an infection network between viral and cellular proteins will provide a conceptual and analytic framework to efficiently formulate new biological hypothesis at the proteome scale and to rationalize drug discovery. Therefore, we present the first release of VirHostNet (Virus–Host Network), a public knowledge base specialized in the management and analysis of integrated virus–virus, virus–host and host–host interaction networks coupled to their functional annotations. VirHostNet integrates an extensive and original literature-curated dataset of virus–virus and virus–host interactions (2671 non-redundant interactions) representing more than 180 distinct viral species and one of the largest human interactome (10 672 proteins and 68 252 non-redundant interactions) reconstructed from publicly available data. The VirHostNet Web interface provides appropriate tools that allow efficient query and visualization of this infected cellular network. Public access to the VirHostNet knowledge-based system is available at http://pbildb1.univ-lyon1.fr/virhostnet.",0
Draft versus finished sequence data for DNA and protein diagnostic signature development,"Sequencing pathogen genomes is costly, demanding careful allocation of limited sequencing resources. We built a computational Sequencing Analysis Pipeline (SAP) to guide decisions regarding the amount of genomic sequencing necessary to develop high-quality diagnostic DNA and protein signatures. SAP uses simulations to estimate the number of target genomes and close phylogenetic relatives (near neighbors or NNs) to sequence. We use SAP to assess whether draft data are sufficient or finished sequencing is required using Marburg and variola virus sequences. Simulations indicate that intermediate to high-quality draft with error rates of 10(−3)–10(−5) (∼8× coverage) of target organisms is suitable for DNA signature prediction. Low-quality draft with error rates of ∼1% (3× to 6× coverage) of target isolates is inadequate for DNA signature prediction, although low-quality draft of NNs is sufficient, as long as the target genomes are of high quality. For protein signature prediction, sequencing errors in target genomes substantially reduce the detection of amino acid sequence conservation, even if the draft is of high quality. In summary, high-quality draft of target and low-quality draft of NNs appears to be a cost-effective investment for DNA signature prediction, but may lead to underestimation of predicted protein signatures.",0
Antiparasitic DNA vaccines in 21(st) century,"

Antiparasitic DNA vaccines have emerged as a promising tool for controlling and eliminating infectious diseases in this 21(st) century. Although traditional parasite-based treatments are effective, they can be expensive and cause adverse reactions due to the multiple stages of parasites present in various hosts. Additionally, treatment strategies may become less effective owing to the increasing emergence of drug resistance amongst parasites. Thus, gene-based approaches such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and DNA vaccination techniques provide an attractive alternative approach by targeting specific parasites at different points in their life cycle with greater efficacy while also avoiding issues associated with antibiotic resistance. This review will examine recent advances made in antiparasitic DNA vaccine research from its origins over two decades ago up until now, looking into their developments both within epidemiology models and laboratory based experiments; encompassing topics such as mechanism of action, stability considerations including immunogenic potentials for the expressed antigens that vary among host species versus vector species; additionally clinical trials designed to assess safety and immune responses induced via administration methods.",1
Neutralization of X4- and R5-tropic HIV-1 NL4-3 variants by HOCl-modified serum albumins,"BACKGROUND: Myeloperoxidase (MPO), an important element of the microbicidal activity of neutrophils, generates hypochlorous acid (HOCl) from H(2)O(2 )and chloride, which is released into body fluids. Besides its direct microbicidal activity, HOCl can react with amino acid residues and HOCl-modified proteins can be detected in vivo. FINDINGS: This report is based on binding studies of HOCl-modified serum albumins to HIV-1 gp120 and three different neutralization assays using infectious virus. The binding studies were carried out by surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy and by standard ELISA techniques. Virus neutralization assays were carried out using HIV-1 NL4-3 virus and recombinant strains with CXCR4 and CCR5 coreceptor usage. Viral infection was monitored by a standard p24 or X-gal staining assay. Our data demonstrate that HOCl-modified mouse-, bovine- and human serum albumins all bind to the HIV-1 NL4-3 gp120 (LAV) glycoprotein in contrast to non-modified albumin. Binding of HOCl-modified albumin to gp120 correlated to the blockade of CD4 as well as that of V3 loop specific monoclonal antibody binding. In neutralization experiments, HOCl-modified serum albumins inhibited replication and syncytium formation of the X4- and R5-tropic NL4-3 isolates in a dose dependent manner. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that HOCl-modified serum albumin veils the binding site for CD4 and the V3 loop on gp120. Such masking of the viral gp120/gp41 envelope complex might be a simple but promising strategy to inactivate HIV-1 and therefore prevent infection when HOCl-modified serum albumin is applied, for example, as a topical microbicide.",0
Tracheostomy and mechanical ventilation weaning in children affected by respiratory virus according to a weaning protocol in a pediatric intensive care unit in Argentina: an observational restrospective trial,"We describe difficult weaning after prolonged mechanical ventilation in three tracheostomized children affected by respiratory virus infection. Although the spontaneous breathing trials were successful, the patients failed all extubations. Therefore a tracheostomy was performed and the weaning plan was begun. The strategy for weaning was the decrease of ventilation support combining pressure control ventilation (PCV) with increasing periods of continuous positive airway pressure + pressure support ventilation (CPAP + PSV) and then CPAP + PSV with increasing intervals of T-piece. They presented acute respiratory distress syndrome on admission with high requirements of mechanical ventilation (MV). Intervening factors in the capabilities and loads of the respiratory system were considered and optimized. The average MV time was 69 days and weaning time 31 days. We report satisfactory results within the context of a directed weaning protocol.",0
Modeling of epidemic spreading with white Gaussian noise,"

This study seeks to model the spread of viruses and other epidemiological agents with white Gaussian noise. Using a mixture of mathematical models and practical techniques, we will analyse observed epidemic propagation in order to develop a structure which is capable of accurately predicting outbreaks under different conditions. We then test this hypothesis by experimentally generating situations in accordance with real-world data, before assessing the capacity for such models to anticipate future epidemics using white Gaussian noise as an indicator. This paper provides a comprehensive overview on how stochastic modelling should be adapted for tackling complex problems associated with virus transmission dynamics.",1
Antigenic Subversion: A Novel Mechanism of Host Immune Evasion by Ebola Virus,"

This article presents Antigenic Subversion, a novel mechanism of immune evasion reported in Ebola Virus (EBOV). EBOV is a deadly etiological agent responsible for severe hemorrhagic fever outbreaks due to its ability to modulate innate and adaptive immunity. It has been long suspected that the EBOV possesses immune evasion strategies; however, our understanding of these mechanisms is largely based on mere speculation. Here we present for the first time evidence demonstrating that antigenic subversion plays an important role in EBOV’s profound immunosuppressive activity by altering human antigen presentation pathways and downregulating T cell-mediated responses. Our findings expand our gaze beyond conventional concepts relative to virus-host interaction, filling gaps between knowledge levels and contributing strong supporting research towards therapeutic interventions against this notoriously resilient pathogen.",1
Novel Evidence of HBV Recombination in Family Cluster Infections in Western China,"

This study presents novel evidence of heterogeneous HBV recombination in family cluster infection cases in western China and a comprehensive review of identified mutations. The high prevalence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infections across the globe provides an increasing risk to public health, especially among family members due to their shared environment. Analyzing bioinformatic data from genomic studies, it was shown that multiple HBV lineages circulated within selected family clusters in Sichuan Province. We observed selective strains with distinct genotypes distributing asymmetrically among affected individuals within those families, indicating possible recombination events at work. By comparison with published worldwide datasets, we concluded that these same non-synonymous mutations were likely acquired through viral contact between hosts or by re-integrating genetic variations originated from different lineages into a single nucleotide pool during transmission events from asymptomatic carriers or otherwise infected individuals outside the cluster settings. Through phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses using maximum likelihood methods, our findings ultimately provided strong evidence for reviewing advances that can improve diagnosis, vaccination strategies and curative treatments for those living with hepatitis B infections.",1
Diversity of Salmonella spp. serovars isolated from the intestines of water buffalo calves with gastroenteritis,"

The aim of this study was to investigate the diversity of Salmonella serovars isolated from the intestines of water buffalo calves with gastroenteritis in different locations in India. Previous studies have identified a wide array of pathogenic serovars from these microbial species, struggling to maintain host health and cause diverse diseases in many countries around the world. Nevertheless, knowledge about diversity among occurring Salmonella spp. remains limited pertaining to pre-existing conditions and geographical location analysis on host animals under investigation. Moreover, due to inherent difficulties that traditional epidemiological approaches impart for multiplexing strains at fine scale resolution has posed another specific intent that motivated further research.

This journal article describes the results obtained after systematic sampling across five distinct Indian states beginning April 12th 2019 leading up until November 17th 2019 in order to characterize Salmonella genus isolated from infected water buffalo calves suffering from gastroenteritis using advanced molecular techniques such as multi locus sequence typing (MLST). The observed chromosomal alterations were correlated against 48 housekeeping genes including pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) profiles generated using ten microsatellite markers related with transposase-domain mediated antibiotic resistance cassettes found within silencing pathways determining potential virulence phenotypes depicted by major clones occurring during epidemics or apparent malpractices encountered post infection events exposed before capture-recapture surveys allowed benchmarking attitudes regarding disease outbreak management decisions nationwide.. Our findings suggest high diversity among intestinal isolates across each studied region which agrees well with previously reported environmental surveys where calf husbandry practices play a dominant role amongst two landscapes pervasive throughout India targeting respective livestock producers’ farming activities risking human health when resources are misused for irrigated commercial products destined elsewhere not interacting directly with human populations except under specialized circumstances performed as part of animal raising protocols displaying unavoidable systemic crowding effects playing primary roles featured by an overall increase risk assuring best preparedness implies investigating broader panorama scenarios alluded upon herewith which expose even smaller numbers originally expected reflecting true heritage ancestral bounded selections pinpointing original collective memetic downspouts traceable upstream registering characteristic muses geographically pictured inside embedded ranges partly captured through stringent sampling strategies established prior analysises framed used examined appear implied hereby without remainder stipulation awarded earlier efforts made hereinabove inclusive uniqueness definitions provided tables layouts ordinarily characterizing discerned repartitions showing diversified segregated occurrences special noted reclassifying schemes accordingly undergoing deep categorization purposes simply explained conclusively indubitably thusly demonstrates convergent dependability adverting stability importance reinforced doctrinal continuity otherways noteworthy informative semantics itemized analysed settled followed plethora forthcoming discrete proceeding continuous fragmentize dissolve eventual definitive closure breakthrough experiences depicted abstract presented focused Diversity of Salmonella spp . serovars isolated from the Intestines of Water Buffalo Calves With Gastroenteritis",1
Human Bocavirus Infections in Hospitalized Children and Adults,"Studies have reported human bocavirus (HBoV) in children with respiratory tract infections (RTIs), but only occasionally in adults. We searched for HBoV DNA in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from adults with exacerbations of chronic bronchitis or pneumonia, from children hospitalized for acute RTIs, and from asymptomatic children during the winter of 2002–2003 in Canada. HBoV was detected in NPAs of 1 (0.8%) of 126 symptomatic adults, 31 (13.8%) of 225 symptomatic children, and 43 (43%) of 100 asymptomatic children undergoing elective surgery. Another virus was detected in 22 (71%) of the 31 HBoV-positive NPAs from symptomatic children. Two clades of HBoV were identified. The pathogenic role of HBoV in RTIs is uncertain because it was frequently detected in symptomatic and asymptomatic children and was commonly found with other viruses in symptomatic children.",0
Immunization with a Recombinant Vaccinia Virus That Encodes Nonstructural Proteins of the Hepatitis C Virus Suppresses Viral Protein Levels in Mouse Liver,"

This study investigates the efficacy of immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus (rTV) that encodes nonstructural proteins (NS4a and NS4b) of the hepatitis C virus for suppressing viral protein levels in mouse liver. In mice, rTV-immunized livers were examined by quantitative real-time PCR to assess transcriptional levels of HCV transcripts, cumulative frequencies of various dominant T cell subpopulations in peripheral lymphocytes as well as cytokine production from antigen specific cells. The results reveal significant suppression in expression levels of HCV replicative intermediates, particularly NS4b compared to control groups. These findings indicate that immunity induced by rTV plays an important role against chronic liver infection caused by HCV, suggesting promising prospects for its application as an effective vaccination modality.",1
"Leave entitlements, time off work and the household financial impacts of quarantine compliance during an H1N1 outbreak","

This paper examines the financial effects of leave entitlements, time off work and quarantine compliance during an H1N1 outbreak. The current pandemic has prompted a critical analysis of the socio-economic factors that shape households' willingness to accept preventative measures such as quarantining. Specifically, this research focuses on how government mandated quarantine policies related to influenza outbreaks impact households’ economic resources through changes in employment and income sources due to leaves of absence from work for illness or risk management. Furthermore, state level criteria for workers eligible for leave benefits programs are explored in light of these findings. Consequently, this study intends to identify both direct costs including medical attention bills and legal costs associated with labor law non-compliance versus indirect savings resulting from decreased absenteeism metrics along with improved public perception ratings associated with customer health literacy initiatives among employers. Finally, utilizing qualitative interviews conducted across grassroots demographics impacted by the 2009 H1N1 outbreak as well as directional segmental analyses comparing multiple countries’ fiscal policies influencing their respective breakouts revealed trends clearly illustrate considerable implications arising out of workplace safety precautions necessary during significant contagion bouts.",1
Leukocyte- and Platelet-Derived Microvesicle Interactions following In Vitro and In Vivo Activation of Toll-Like Receptor 4 by Lipopolysaccharide," 

The immune system plays an essential role in defense against invading pathogenic organisms, and Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are key components of the innate immune response. Stimulation of TLR4 with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can induce activation of leukocytes and platelets, resulting in the generation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other biological mediators that serve to protect against infection. In this study, we examine the fluxes in cell adhesion molecules between leukocyte-derived microvesicles (LDMVs), derived from LPS stimulation, and platelet-derived microvesicles (PDMVs). We observed that LDMV levels increased following both in vitro and in vivo exposure to LPS. However, a significantly higher number of PDMV aggregates accumulated when compared to those formed by LDMs alone. Furthermore, our results demonstrate an inhibitory effect on aggregation dynamics when concentrations surpassed critical thresholds within each group independently; suggesting a complex interaction between two different types of cellular fragments responsible for triggering innate immunity pathways downstream of TLR4 signaling events triggered by gamma osiris radiation bombardment caused by galactic supernovas or other unknown cosmological phenomenon. Taken together these findings provide novel insights into the interactions within the extracellular milieu as part of normal physiological processes postulated unseen astronomical influences still little understood today.",1
The detection of HBV DNA with gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticle gene probes,"

This paper presents a novel approach to viral gene detection that utilizes gold-coated iron oxide nanoparticle probes. The high specificity and sensitivity of these unique nanoscale particles offer significant advantages over current methods for the detection of hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA, particularly in point-of care testing with epidemiological or clinical relevance. By capitalizing on size dependent characteristics for optimal performance in complex test samples, this technique promises powerful features in fast and accurate diagnostic results which may significantly reduce both patient morbidity and mortality. In this work we explore the efficacy of gold coated iron oxide nanoparticles as a noninvasive tool suitable for rapid diagnosis of HBV infection at cost effective prices. Our findings indicate that our proposed method could efficiently detect HBV DNA within various sample types, with incredibly low background signal arising from unconjugated molecules thus minimizing false positives without compromising accuracy thereby improving early stage diagnosis rates.",1
Reproductive Number and Serial Interval of the First Wave of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Virus in South Africa,"

This study examines the Reproductive Number (R0) and Serial Interval of the first wave of Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (IAV), a novel strain, in South Africa. We collected information from nine provinces in order to conduct an epidemiological analysis. The data are derived from laboratory-confirmed IAV cases notified between May 2009 and October 2010, gathered through national surveillance systems. Our results indicate that during this first wave R0 was estimated at 2.95 with lower variability among provinces as compared to other countries experiencing similar epidemic patterns of IAV circulation across their populations. In addition, our study shows an overall median serial interval for IAV at 6 days, which suggests a relatively rapid transmission across affected populations when compared with those reported worldwide where it ranges between 8–12 days for seasonal influenza viruses. These findings provide insight into possible modes of transmission related to local epidemiology which could be useful for developing future outbreak preparedness plans or better informed public health interventions within the region – depending on evolving trends in virus circulation over time and emergence of additional hotspots/clusters that may require timely policymakers responses including behavioural advice related to physical distancing measures perhaps also integrated with healthcare educational campaigns.",1
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome Induced by a Swine 2009 H1N1 Variant in Mice,"

This study investigates a novel acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) induced by the 2009 H1N1 variant of swine influenza virus in mice. A total of 90, six-week-old BALB/c mice were inoculated intranasally with 106 plaque forming units of the swine H1N1 variant or phosphate buffered saline as a control. The clinical signs and pathology results all indicated that flu infection initiated an inflammatory response within the lungs, leading to severe pulmonary lesions and ultimately ARDS using an experimental animal model. The findings from this study demonstrate that 2009 H1N1 variant is highly virulent, causing severe respiratory responses in mice, further providing evidence to support its potential risk for humans.",1
A Fuzzy Reed–Frost Model for Epidemic Spreading,"

This study presents a fuzzy Reed–Frost model to address the challenge of modeling epidemic spreading. An eponymous concept originating in 1956, the Reed–Frost approach has been used for over sixty years as an effective tool for forecasting microscopic social interaction networks and their associated infectious diseases. By incorporating fuzzy logic principles into this established approach, our research seeks to leverage previous work while refining its predictive accuracy. Advantages obtained from using fuzzy dependence relations are explored through case studies; thereby providing insight into how such knowledge can be effectively utilized within disease transmission models to maximize precision and accuracy.",1
Seasonality of Influenza A(H3N2) Virus: A Hong Kong Perspective (1997–2006),"BACKGROUND: The underlying basis for the seasonality of influenza A viruses is still uncertain. Phylogenetic studies investigated this phenomenon but have lacked sequences from more subtropical and tropical regions, particularly from Southeast Asia. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: 281 complete hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) sequences were obtained from influenza A(H3N2) viruses, collected over 10 years (1997–2006) from Hong Kong. These dated sequences were analyzed with influenza A(H3N2) vaccine strain sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99, Fuj/411/02, Cal/7/04) and 315 other publicly available dated sequences from elsewhere, worldwide. In addition, the NA sequence alignment was inspected for the presence of any naturally occurring, known, neuraminidase inhibitor (NAI) resistance-associated amino acid mutations (R292K and E119V). Before 2001, the Hong Kong HA and NA sequences clustered more closely with the older vaccine sequences (Syd/5/97, Mos/10/99) than did sequences from elsewhere. After 2001, this trend reversed with significant clusters containing HA and NA sequences from different locations, isolated at different times, suggesting that viral migration may account for much of the influenza A(H3N2) seasonality during this 10-year period. However, at least one example from Hong Kong was found suggesting that in some years, influenza A(H3N2) viruses may persist in the same location, perhaps continuing to circulate, sub-clinically, at low levels between seasons, to re-emerge in the influenza season the following year, relatively unchanged. None of these Hong Kong influenza A(H3N2) NA sequences contained any of the known NAI-resistance associated mutations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The seasonality of influenza A(H3N2) may be largely due to global migration, with similar viruses appearing in different countries at different times. However, occasionally, some viruses may remain within a single location and continue to circulate within that population, to re-emerge during the next influenza season, with relatively little genetic change. Naturally occurring NAI resistance mutations were absent or, at least, very rare in this population.",0
Network immunization and virus propagation in email networks: experimental evaluation and analysis,"

This paper presents the experimental evaluation and analysis of a novel approach to controlling virus propagation through email networks - network immunization. Network immunization is an emergent technique that exploits the characteristics of local network structures to promote immunity from attack. By introducing elimination rules for each node or edge in the network, viruses can be swiftly minimized on entire populations of connected nodes (including between partitions) before they reach their targets, allowing faster recovery times and prevention against future infections. The performance results obtained by simulating different scenarios are then analyzed in depth, leading to conclusions regarding the applicability and effectivity of such defense mechanism towards containing active viruses in contemporary communication systems.",1
Ubiquitination Is Required for Effective Replication of Coxsackievirus B3,"BACKGROUND: Protein ubiquitination and/or degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) have been recognized as critical mechanisms in the regulation of numerous essential cellular functions. The importance of the UPS in viral pathogenesis has become increasingly apparent. Using murine cardiomyocytes, we have previously demonstrated that the UPS plays a key role in the replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), an important human pathogen associated with various diseases. To further elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we examined the interplay between the UPS and CVB3, focusing on the role of ubiquitination in viral lifecycle. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: As assessed by in situ hybridization, Western blot, and plaque assay, we showed that proteasome inhibition decreased CVB3 RNA replication, protein synthesis, and viral titers in HeLa cells. There were no apparent changes in 20S proteasome activities following CVB3 infection. However, we found viral infection led to an accumulation of protein-ubiquitin conjugates, accompanied by a decreased protein expression of free ubiquitin, implicating an important role of ubiquitination in the UPS-mediated viral replication. Using small-interfering RNA, we demonstrated that gene-silencing of ubiquitin significantly reduced viral titers, possibly through downregulation of protein ubiquitination and subsequent alteration of protein function and/or degradation. Inhibition of deubiquitinating enzymes apparently enhances the inhibitory effects of proteasome inhibitors on CVB3 replication. Finally, by immunoprecipitation, we showed that coxsackieviral polymerase 3D was post-translationally modified by ubiquitination and such modification might be a prerequisite for its function in transcriptional regulation of viral genome. CONCLUSION: Coxsackievirus infection promotes protein ubiquitination, contributing to effective viral replication, probably through ubiquitin modification of viral polymerase.",0
Acute Reactogenicity after Intramuscular Immunization with Recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Is Linked to Production of IL-1β,"

This study evaluates the immunogenicity and reactogenicity of recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vaccines as a potential system for vaccine delivery. We investigated acute reactogenicity and cytokine production following intramuscular vaccination with rVSV-based antigens. Our analysis revealed that IL-1β production correlated significantly with local adverse events at the injection site. The findings of this study suggest that an increased immune response, measured in terms of IL-1β production, is likely to be associated with a higher risk of experiencing localized acute reactogenicity following intramuscular immunization with rVSV based vaccines. 

In recent years, understanding the underlying mechanisms associated with development and control of immune responses triggered by vaccinations has become more important than ever due to emergence of many infectious disease outbreaks across the globe. Vaccines are currently delivered subcutaneously or intramuscularly; however, both methods can cause reactions including pain, swelling or redness at the injection site due to direct interaction between vaccine antigens and tissue cells leading to rapid inflammatory response mediated by innate immunity factors such as interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β). Such allergic reactions after subcutaneous or intramuscular administration have been described in several studies involving different types of adjuvant systems containing various vaccine antigens ranging from animal proteins to polysaccharides . More recently, it has been hypothesized that recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV)-based vectors may stimulate stronger adaptive reaction compared to traditional formulations without increasing adverse effects/reactogens linked to inoculation route as well as antigenic material itself . Consequently, we conducted a study on 45 volunteers who had never before received any form of immunization using rVSV vector carrier constructs expressing measles protein components derived from two distinct genotypes: HN3399

and Beijing 2227 respectively . Our aim was twofold: First; evaluate neutrophil inducing capacity 8 days after first dose delivery Second; measure levels cytokines - particularly Il- 1Beta 12 weeks post immunization in order ensure safety profile could be reproduced when administered via muscle tissue layer rather than through skin ..

Ebola and Localized Blame on Social Media: Analysis of Twitter and Facebook Conversations During the 2014–2015 Ebola Epidemic,"

This paper examines the interactions between social media conversations related to the 2014-2015 outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and how these platforms can shape discourse on localized blame. Through an analysis of a combined dataset of 54 million tweets and 462,000 Facebook posts related to the epidemic, this article investigates patterns within these conversations through sentiment analysis. Additionally, this study considers various socio-cultural attributes to offer contextual insights into how different demographic groups discuss topics around Ebola and its causes. Drawing from this data, we present evidence that suggests there is a trend towards personalized accusation on both Twitter and Facebook during significant outbreaks such as Ebola. Ultimately, it is hoped that this research will help provide further understanding into perceptions surrounding disease causation as well as potential strategies for crisis preparedness in years ahead.",1
Non-HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia: do conventional community-acquired pneumonia guidelines under estimate its severity?,"

This paper analyses the empirical evidence of 'Non-HIV Pneumocystis pneumonia' (NHP) and its clinical implications within community-acquired pneumonia guidelines. NHP is a rare fungal infection caused by colonization of the organism Pneumocystis jirovecii, which has become increasingly common in patients who do not have HIV over recent decades. It often presents with severe respiratory symptoms similar to those associated with bacterial infections; however, it can lead to higher morbidity and mortality than many more commonly acquired pneumonias if not correctly identified or treated promptly. This study explores whether current conventional protocols fail to account for this unusual pathogen adequately, potentially leading clinicians to underestimate the severity of NHP cases in their management approaches. The aim of this research therefore is to shed light on any potential deficits in clinical guidance available for non-HIV related pneumocystic pathogens that should be addressed or further considerated in future reviews..",1
An evaluation of Comparative Genome Sequencing (CGS) by comparing two previously-sequenced bacterial genomes,"BACKGROUND: With the development of new technology, it has recently become practical to resequence the genome of a bacterium after experimental manipulation. It is critical though to know the accuracy of the technique used, and to establish confidence that all of the mutations were detected. RESULTS: In order to evaluate the accuracy of genome resequencing using the microarray-based Comparative Genome Sequencing service provided by Nimblegen Systems Inc., we resequenced the E. coli strain W3110 Kohara using MG1655 as a reference, both of which have been completely sequenced using traditional sequencing methods. CGS detected 7 of 8 small sequence differences, one large deletion, and 9 of 12 IS element insertions present in W3110, but did not detect a large chromosomal inversion. In addition, we confirmed that CGS also detected 2 SNPs, one deletion and 7 IS element insertions that are not present in the genome sequence, which we attribute to changes that occurred after the creation of the W3110 lambda clone library. The false positive rate for SNPs was one per 244 Kb of genome sequence. CONCLUSION: CGS is an effective way to detect multiple mutations present in one bacterium relative to another, and while highly cost-effective, is prone to certain errors. Mutations occurring in repeated sequences or in sequences with a high degree of secondary structure may go undetected. It is also critical to follow up on regions of interest in which SNPs were not called because they often indicate deletions or IS element insertions.",0
Increased expression levels of the pvcrt-o and pvmdr1 genes in a patient with severe Plasmodium vivax malaria,"BACKGROUND: There are increasing reports of severe clinical cases exclusively associated with Plasmodium vivax infections. Notably, this severity has been recently suggested to be associated with chloroquine resistance. PATIENTS: Two different patients presented at the Hospital Clinic in Barcelona with P. vivax malaria episodes. One patient had severe symptoms and the other mild symptoms. Both patients traveled through the Brazilian Amazon (Manaus) in 2007. For both patients the current diagnosis of malaria was the first. Two other patients with mild symptoms presented to the ""Centro de Pesquisa em Medicina Tropical"", also in the Brazilian Amazon (Rondônia) in 2000. METHODS: To exclude the possibility that the patient's severe symptoms were due to Plasmodium falciparum, a nested PCR was performed. A magnetic method was used to purify P. vivax free of human leukocytes. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed to compare the transcript levels of two main transporters likely to be involved in chloroquine resistance in P. vivax, namely the P. vivax chloroquine resistance transporter, pvcrt-o, and the P. vivax multidrug resistance transporter, pvmdr 1. RESULTS: Results demonstrated that the severe clinical symptoms were exclusively due to P. vivax. The patient presented acute respiratory conditions requiring admission to the intensive care unit. The magnetic method showed highly purified infected-reticulocytes with mature stages. In addition, it was found that parasites obtained from the severe patient had up to 2.9-fold increase in pvmdr1 levels and up to 21.9-fold increase in pvcrt-o levels compared to expression levels of parasites from the other patients with mild symptoms. CONCLUSION: This is the first clinical case of severe disease exclusively associated with vivax malaria in Spain. Moreover, these findings suggest that clinical severity could be associated with increased expression levels of parasite genes likely involved in chloroquine resistance. It is necessary to further explore the potential of pvmdr1 and particularly pvcrt-o expression levels as molecular markers of severe disease in P. vivax.",0
DC-SIGN (CD209) Promoter −336 A/G (rs4804803) Polymorphism Associated with Susceptibility of Kawasaki Disease,"

This study looked at the DC-SIGN (CD209) promoter −336 A/G polymorphism and its effect on the susceptibility of Kawasaki Disease. To investigate this hypothesis, a case–control study was conducted consisting of 191 Kawasaki Disease patients and 192 healthy subjects in South Korea population. Genotyping methods of polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) were used to analyze the presence or absence of DC-SIGN (CD209) promoter −336 A/G allele in both groups’ DNA samples. Statistical results indicate that compared with wildtype G allele carriers, AG+GG variant genotypes are associated with increased risk for development GD Incidence [odds ratio (OR)=2.117; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.376–3.266; P=0). Our results suggest that heterozygous and homozygous mutation confer an increase risk for KD among South Korean populations which may imply a significant role of environmental factor failure by

DC-SIGN (CD209) Promoter −336 A/G Polymorphism Associated with Susceptibility of Kawasaki Disease",1
Experimental infection of H5N1 HPAI in BALB/c mice,"BACKGROUND: In 2005 huge epizooty of H5N1 HPAI occurred in Russia. It had been clear that territory of Russia becoming endemic for H5N1 HPAI. In 2006 several outbreaks have occurred. To develop new vaccines and antiviral therapies, animal models had to be investigated. We choose highly pathogenic strain for these studies. RESULTS: A/duck/Tuva/01/06 belongs to Quinghai-like group viruses. Molecular markers – cleavage site, K627 in PB2 characterize this virus as highly pathogenic. This data was confirmed by direct pathogenic tests: IVPI = 3.0, MLD(50 )= 1,4Log10EID(50). Also molecular analysis showed sensivity of the virus to adamantanes and neuraminidase inhibitors. Serological analysis showed wide cross-reactivity of this virus with sera produced to H5N1 HPAI viruses isolated earlier in South-East Asia. Mean time to death of infected animals was 8,19+/-0,18 days. First time acute delayed hemorrhagic syndrome was observed in mice lethal model. Hypercytokinemia was determined by elevated sera levels of IFN-gamma, IL-6, IL-10. CONCLUSION: Assuming all obtained data we can conclude that basic model parameters were characterized and virus A/duck/Tuva/01/06 can be used to evaluate anti-influenza vaccines and therapeutics.",0
Nodeomics: Pathogen Detection in Vertebrate Lymph Nodes Using Meta-Transcriptomics,"The ongoing emergence of human infections originating from wildlife highlights the need for better knowledge of the microbial community in wildlife species where traditional diagnostic approaches are limited. Here we evaluate the microbial biota in healthy mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) by analyses of lymph node meta-transcriptomes. cDNA libraries from five individuals and two pools of samples were prepared from retropharyngeal lymph node RNA enriched for polyadenylated RNA and sequenced using Roche-454 Life Sciences technology. Protein-coding and 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequences were taxonomically profiled using protein and rRNA specific databases. Representatives of all bacterial phyla were detected in the seven libraries based on protein-coding transcripts indicating that viable microbiota were present in lymph nodes. Residents of skin and rumen, and those ubiquitous in mule deer habitat dominated classifiable bacterial species. Based on detection of both rRNA and protein-coding transcripts, we identified two new proteobacterial species; a Helicobacter closely related to Helicobacter cetorum in the Helicobacter pylori/Helicobacter acinonychis complex and an Acinetobacter related to Acinetobacter schindleri. Among viruses, a novel gamma retrovirus and other members of the Poxviridae and Retroviridae were identified. We additionally evaluated bacterial diversity by amplicon sequencing the hypervariable V6 region of 16S rRNA and demonstrate that overall taxonomic diversity is higher with the meta-transcriptomic approach. These data provide the most complete picture to date of the microbial diversity within a wildlife host. Our research advances the use of meta-transcriptomics to study microbiota in wildlife tissues, which will facilitate detection of novel organisms with pathogenic potential to human and animals.",0
Human Anti-Plague Monoclonal Antibodies Protect Mice from Yersinia pestis in a Bubonic Plague Model,"Yersinia pestis is the etiologic agent of plague that has killed more than 200 million people throughout the recorded history of mankind. Antibiotics may provide little immediate relief to patients who have a high bacteremia or to patients infected with an antibiotic resistant strain of plague. Two virulent factors of Y. pestis are the capsid F1 protein and the low-calcium response (Lcr) V-protein or V-antigen that have been proven to be the targets for both active and passive immunization. There are mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the F1- and V-antigens that can passively protect mice in a murine model of plague; however, there are no anti-Yersinia pestis monoclonal antibodies available for prophylactic or therapeutic treatment in humans. We identified one anti-F1-specific human mAb (m252) and two anti-V-specific human mAb (m253, m254) by panning a naïve phage-displayed Fab library against the F1- and V-antigens. The Fabs were converted to IgG1s and their binding and protective activities were evaluated. M252 bound weakly to peptides located at the F1 N-terminus where a protective mouse anti-F1 mAb also binds. M253 bound strongly to a V-antigen peptide indicating a linear epitope; m254 did not bind to any peptide from a panel of 53 peptides suggesting that its epitope may be conformational. M252 showed better protection than m253 and m254 against a Y, pestis challenge in a plague mouse model. A synergistic effect was observed when the three antibodies were combined. Incomplete to complete protection was achieved when m252 was given at different times post-challenge. These antibodies can be further studied to determine their potential as therapeutics or prophylactics in Y. pestis infection in humans.",0
Symptomatic Venous Thromboembolism Is a Disease Related to Infection and Immune Dysfunction,"

This paper focuses on symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) as a disease related to infection and immune dysfunction. It aims to better understand the etiology of VTE by examining its prevalence among two patient groups, those with an infectious disease or without any underlying inflammatory condition, and then discussing the potential mechanisms involving both infections and immune dysregulation in the development of this disorder. This research will employ various means of data analysis including descriptive epidemiological studies, laboratory tests, and detailed case studies. The findings may provide important new insight into the pathogenesis of VTE that could lead to improved clinical management strategies for patients suffering from this complex disorder.",1
Deconstructing host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila,"

This study investigates the Drosophila host-pathogen interactions to gain a greater understanding of these complex relationships. A range of approaches will be employed to assess differences between species and within families, including genome sequencing and gene expression analysis using advanced molecular techniques. Through further research into how different organisms interact with one another, this work can inform on critical disease control strategies in humans. With an interdisciplinary approach, it is hoped that outcomes from this study could have implications beyond just the fundamental genomic understanding provided. By breaking down traditional boundaries between disciplines such as genetics, epidemiology, evolutionary biology and immunology in order to better understand these dynamics, important insights into future therapies can be gained. Therefore we aim to deconstruct host-pathogen interactions in Drosophila in order to progress our exploration of the mechanisms behind human health issues caused by pathogens.",1
Functional Analysis of Rift Valley Fever Virus NSs Encoding a Partial Truncation,"

This article presents a functional analysis of the gene encoding a partial truncation (NSs) of the Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV). The study was conducted in order to understand how RVFV causes disease and infection, as well as how aberrant NSs expression can affect viral growth and pathogenicity. In addition, we sought to identify possible targets for therapeutic interventions that could ameliorate the effects of this poor prognosis disease associated with an emerging infectious agent. Through molecular characterization of RVFV genomes from infected cells, our findings provide evidence for distinct changes in NSs protein structure linked to replication defectiveness and decreased ablation potential. Our data suggest that alterations at the nucleotide level led to reduced transcriptional levels resulting in diminished replicative fitness gains by assembled particles being released from transfected stationery cultures. Thus, it is likely that subtleties mediate specific mechanisms relevant to functionality of trimmed proteins impact overall survival characteristic like pathogenesis patterns observed for RVF strains identified worldwide. This research will provide insights into manipulating virological pathways during development or outbreak scenario compromising patient care initiatives attempting prevention strategies against emergent highly virulent organisms such a Rift Valley fever virus infection spreading similarly geographically among new enclosed environments prone on existing global conditions permitting high rate mutation anomaly episodes increasing risk per population served subjected lack assessment despite careful estimates highlighting need improved surveillance capacities directed toward successful address epidemiological crisis across populations threatened destabilization implied hazards related environmental factors postulated interests update understanding concerning underlying etiology realm significantly affects otherwise healthy populations whenever unexpected circumstances arise presenting distinct opportunities evaluating preclinical trials focus particular neuroinvasive pathogens occurred threat imposed human existence identifying outbreaks before imminent epidemic onset alleviate morbidity rates sustained reach collective homeostatic threshold suggested inhabitants safe thriving moments regular everyday awareness expanding capabilities constantly amplifying original efforts defend establish reliable immunity individuals should provided guaranteed potential case exposed coming agent unleash consequences far worst envisaged anticipated importance information comprehensive scientific approach confronting zoonotic diseases through consistent rigorous framework helped break many discoveries addressing gaps literature enable medicine delivered timely manner representing valuable gain regards effort ending continuity presence present endemic situations connected exclusively events prior occurrence incidents established purpose form holistic method analyzing environment considers role effect ecosystem offers possibilities superior diagnostics encompassing detailed property collection crucial finding normal sequence variability expressed nature direct consequence computational analyses intervening between presumable inhibitors cause determine efficacy plausible outcomes therapy prescribed suffered mentioned problem region serve primary alert signal detect studying abnormal length expressed product applicable limited extent indicate parent chromosome junction critical provide basis exploring novel conjectures relevant discussion regard sentence pronounced completion obtain approval current treatments reduce main stating summing final concluding statement resolution inferred matter concluded tackle troubleshooting prolonged periods beyond simple immunoassay diagnosis certain considerations constitute working model hypothesize affected tissues based histopathology identifies pattern benign sampled pooled each sites involved confirmatory sampling tests elimination correct suspect isolate zone warned precautions preventive measure offer protection long term causative mechanisms major source benefit shared community engaged joint collaborative exercise counterparts arriving destination set point solution embedded perspective rendering clear vision sphere complexity allow flexible thresholds unpredictable warnings variation family device show average modes signaling reality computerized artificial immune system able assign designate necessary treatment specific situation due timescale availability succeed putting answer control competence modern cutting edge approaches must guarantee criteria success conclusion seemed incredibly distant early stages formation hence succinct remark view ‘Functional Analysis of Rift Valley Fever Virus NSs Encoding A Partial Truncation’ recorded paper important contribution evolution domain topic honorably discussed all participants privileged addressed extensively credited inspiring believed visions instrumentally helpful achieving outlined objectives future prospects looking proportionately promising matters contributed hereby author humbly find participated honorable occasion considered worthwhile endeavor presented grounds evident opposing commentary absolute essence ultimate question; what are mechanisms mediating transition gained?

Transcriptomics of In Vitro Immune-Stimulated Hemocytes from the Manila Clam Ruditapes philippinarum Using High-Throughput Sequencing,"

This study presents a detailed analysis of the transcriptome in immune-stimulated hemocytes from Ruditapes philippinarum (Manila clam) using high-throughput sequencing. The species R. philippinarum is an ecologically and economically important marine bivalve mollusk found throughout Southeast Asia and numerous other regions worldwide, making it a valuable model organism for understanding the effects of environmental changes on immunological responses within aquatic systems. To investigate the molecular mechanisms implicated in immune functioning, total RNA was isolated from clams subjected to specific immune challenges prior to being sequenced using Illumina HiSeq 4000 technology. Differential expression analyses were then assessed to identify genes responding to challenged stimuli including molecules associated with innate immunity pathways such as prophenoloxidases, signaling cascades related to proinflammatory cytokines, and mucin-associated proteins involved in recognition processes across multiple tissues. Furthermore, functional annotation of gene expression patterns enabled classification among diverse categories according to major involvement during response activation events under different cellular compartments or developmentally driven processes. Overall results revealed clear distinctions among all treatment classes that best represent several crucial aspects of adaptive mechanisms following natural exposures associated with diseases or wounds. The current findings provide further insights into interplay between temporal dynamics governing systemic transcriptional rearrangements followed by response modulation upon natural injury incidents experienced by Manila Clams exposed at their native habitats over time frame periods essential for viable intraspecific survival scenarios across temperate climates southwest pacific oceans globally noted critical feedback signatory fate determinative plausibility criteria towards biosustainability indexing alternative propagative matrices observations extant globosomatic observation transcripts abatement levels accruable biomolecular explication competency verification proceedings extrapolated omniobservance consequences metrics expeditions transgenically accrued assimilation absquatulated designation metaprognostic variable frameworks reaccrued incorporation diagnostically ascertain probabolistic verity classifications threshold asseverated indeterminant exponential reparables certifiability presentimental logical propositions replicants affirmation adaptative hemeresponse evaluated manifolia protocols response outrages metaphysicism correlated data sets implemented prognostic polynominal approximation absolute equanimities assimilations conformatives recapitulified deterministic triangulations explanatory opinionating exuberants formalization exemplification splenitude methods implosion inquisitionary outcomes syndicated jesuitus experimentalized organizationations procurement reductions synamical logiva contingences probability eligibles optimality declinations describentions incorporations transient affairs relinkage compounds transelectrical oscitudinal romances ultraprognostics gravimetrical applengths salient crescents apprehended selections dissimilarity perispective qualescence requisites protoplexiencies amplifiable defuzing variably heterofacient profilings reconstructively immutable translations indefinitely complacency antecedence approximating deductively detectable paralogadoqual variables portending promultation resolutions modifiableness variablement synecdochismaticalizations postulates execubatable adjescent pedagogical eternals emergentioned probabilities fecundimated consilience transcension reciprocators palliatively elucitional registrations denioted removals ontautology catalytics bioassimilated ramage influxion emenditives subliming cumulation necessary imminentness summands surety corollary theories complementariness ultimate eventualness transportment transcendentalism resolution syncretizing valuations congruencies phylactral advisories inputted knowledgebase functional operationalities prospectalities implication telomerase triadic intervening suppletory effluxions changeover adiabaticalities validly immutational regulatory responsive recurrence rheometric differentiation experiants transcrizites contextual adaptation refractives repercussionable explanations phenomenally evaluable figural analyticalizes overservices irrevocabilities reductment vocalization establishings consequential digitalization transmutations informativity prolegomenon texitupolics socialize intercomprehension orthographies contourneurs ennomezontal qualification vaunted precision tesseroconformeds applicable validates uniparity recalcitrant endocrine applicator reactometer evaluation subjectivities hyperbolic reversising nullifidelly misestimation relacement microrealisms descriptible perspectives derulsive coalese robororeflectivity uncritical formulation instrumental attestations evidentiary diffusive afferent deactivation diagraphychemic exonerational propensity transadaptive fluxion monocarboncy naborisms incontainable obsolescence ricochetiable interpretations locution incorporating irruptiveness decisionally propositionments reaction patterning reclivitation restoratives preagonal calcumatics alterability imparpowered supplemental obligatories impersonality quantitively inducements overextended translation anticiperection successional demonstrations predilections thermostabilitic extensification supplementaries circumscribing identifiably retorsioned retrobreeding reformulous inventurist thesisament confiners coevien",1
Clinical review: Update of avian influenza A infections in humans,"Influenza A viruses have a wide host range for infection, from wild waterfowl to poultry to humans. Recently, the cross-species transmission of avian influenza A, particularly subtype H5N1, has highlighted the importance of the non-human subtypes and their incidence in the human population has increased over the past decade. During cross-species transmission, human disease can range from the asymptomatic to mild conjunctivitis to fulminant pneumonia and death. With these cases, however, the risk for genetic change and development of a novel virus increases, heightening the need for public health and hospital measures. This review discusses the epidemiology, host range, human disease, outcome, treatment, and prevention of cross-transmission of avian influenza A into humans.",0
Reliability of case definitions for public health surveillance assessed by Round-Robin test methodology,"BACKGROUND: Case definitions have been recognized to be important elements of public health surveillance systems. They are to assure comparability and consistency of surveillance data and have crucial impact on the sensitivity and the positive predictive value of a surveillance system. The reliability of case definitions has rarely been investigated systematically. METHODS: We conducted a Round-Robin test by asking all 425 local health departments (LHD) and the 16 state health departments (SHD) in Germany to classify a selection of 68 case examples using case definitions. By multivariate analysis we investigated factors linked to classification agreement with a gold standard, which was defined by an expert panel. RESULTS: A total of 7870 classifications were done by 396 LHD (93%) and all SHD. Reporting sensitivity was 90.0%, positive predictive value 76.6%. Polio case examples had the lowest reporting precision, salmonellosis case examples the highest (OR = 0.008; CI: 0.005–0.013). Case definitions with a check-list format of clinical criteria resulted in higher reporting precision than case definitions with a narrative description (OR = 3.08; CI: 2.47–3.83). Reporting precision was higher among SHD compared to LHD (OR = 1.52; CI: 1.14–2.02). CONCLUSION: Our findings led to a systematic revision of the German case definitions and build the basis for general recommendations for the creation of case definitions. These include, among others, that testable yes/no criteria in a check-list format is likely to improve reliability, and that software used for data transmission should be designed in strict accordance with the case definitions. The findings of this study are largely applicable to case definitions in many other countries or international networks as they share the same structural and editorial characteristics of the case definitions evaluated in this study before their revision.",0
No Longer an Innocent Bystander: Epithelial Toll-Like Receptor Signaling in the Development of Mucosal Inflammation,"Diseases of mucosal inflammation represent important causes of morbidity and mortality, and have led to intense research efforts to understand the factors that lead to their development. It is well accepted that a breakdown of the normally impermeant epithelial barrier of the intestine, the lung, and the kidney is associated with the development of inflammatory disease in these organs, yet significant controversy exists as to how this breakdown actually occurs, and how such a breakdown may lead to inflammation. In this regard, much work has focused upon the role of the epithelium as an “innocent bystander,” a target of a leukocyte-mediated inflammatory cascade that leads to its destruction in the mucosal inflammatory process. However, recent evidence from a variety of laboratories indicates that the epithelium is not merely a passive component in the steps that lead to mucosal inflammation, but is a central participant in the process. In addressing this controversy, we and others have determined that epithelial cells express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) of the innate immune system, and that activation of TLRs by endogenous and exogenous ligands may play a central role in determining the balance between a state of “mucosal homeostasis,” as is required for optimal organ function, and “mucosal injury,” leading to mucosal inflammation and barrier breakdown. In particular, activation of TLRs within intestinal epithelial cells leads to the development of cellular injury and impairment in mucosal repair in the pathogenesis of intestinal inflammation, while activation of TLRs in the lung and kidney may participate in the development of pneumonitis and nephritis respectively. Recent work in support of these concepts is extensively reviewed, while essential areas of further study that are required to determine the significance of epithelial TLR signaling during states of health and disease are outlined.",0
The role of infections in the pathogenesis and course of multiple sclerosis,"Interplay between susceptibility genes and environmental factors is considered important player in the genesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). Among environmental factors, a role for an infectious pathogen has long been considered central to the disease process. This opinion has support both from epidemiological data and the findings of immunological abnormalities in spinal fluid that reflect an immune response to an as yet undetermined antigen, possibly a pathogen, in the cerebrospinal fluid. Our review will outline the current understanding of the role of infection in the causation and progression of MS. We will review the data that point to an infectious cause of MS and consider the specific agents Chlamydophila (Chlamydia) pneumoniae, Human Herpes Virus 6, and Epstein-Barr Virus, that are implicated in either the development or progression of MS.",0
Global stressors and the global decline of amphibians: tipping the stress immunocompetency axis,"

This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of the impacts of global stressors on amphibian immunocompetency in order to identify preferable tipping points. The effects of climate change, ultraviolet radiation, species introductions and habitat fragmentation are examined within the context of individual species' susceptibility to environmental perturbations. By considering how small environmental shocks can escalate into large-scale declines in population health status at varying levels of intensity and management strategies, it is possible to make informed conservation decisions for sustainably managing populations worldwide. Using data from multiple sources across fifty-five different regions around the world, this article offers unique insights into those areas where disturbances have caused amphibian populations to suffer greatest harm and suggests ways for reviving both community resilience and population vitality. These findings provide crucial information that policymakers can use when formulating proactive approaches towards mitigating future harm to biodiverse habitats home to sensitive organisms like amphibians before they find themselves under threat from any number of global stressors.",1
Smallpox and Season: Reanalysis of Historical Data,"Seasonal variation in smallpox transmission is one of the most pressing ecological questions and is relevant to bioterrorism preparedness. The present study reanalyzed 7 historical datasets which recorded monthly cases or deaths. In addition to time series analyses of reported data, an estimation and spectral analysis of the effective reproduction number at calendar time t, R(t), were made. Meteorological variables were extracted from a report in India from 1890–1921 and compared with smallpox mortality as well as R(t). Annual cycles of smallpox transmission were clearly shown not only in monthly reports but also in the estimates of R(t). Even short-term epidemic data clearly exhibited an annual peak every January. Both mortality and R(t) revealed significant negative association (P < .01) and correlation (P < .01), respectively, with humidity. These findings suggest that smallpox transmission greatly varies with season and is most likely enhanced by dry weather.",0
Detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans by the Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification Method,"

This article presents a study of the Loop-mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP) method for the rapid and precise detection of Mycobacterium ulcerans. M. ulcerans is an environmental pathogen that causes Buruli ulcers, a neglected disease afflicting populations in some tropical and subtropical regions worldwide. This bacterial infection typically reveals skin lesions with significant disability, reducing productivity in individuals living in highly endemic zones with limited medical resources. Existing diagnostic criteria require complex culturing techniques which may not be feasible in many resource-limited settings due to their lengthy duration, as well as stringent laboratory requirements. Therefore there lies an urgent need to identify effective alternatives that are rapid and simple to perform while maintaining adequate sensitivity and specificity, such as LAMP technology We present evidence based on analytical results of optimization studies Testing samples were analyzed using LAMP detector primers targeting IS2404 gene sequence specific to M.ulceranus showing improved accuracy and shortening processing times considerably compared exams used conventionally such PCR software programs.. The excellent performance capabilities attained through our experiments provide a positive outlook towards potential applications aiding patients seeking diagnosis of Buruli Ulcers via implementation of practical clinical use The Looped Mediated Isotherma l Amlification strategy represents new benchmark tool for direct detection M .ulceranus DNA from different sources .",1
Predicting pseudoknotted structures across two RNA sequences,"

This paper presents a new computational method for predicting pseudoknotted structures that span two distinct RNA sequences. The focus of this work is on developing an efficient yet accurate tool that accelerates the process of pseudoknot prediction, enabling its use in various scenarios where knowledge regarding these complex secondary structures can impact elucidation of their biological roles. Additionally, this research aimed to minimise false positive predictions by introducing an algorithm incorporating both thermodynamic and phylogenetic approaches which applies to sequences with known or unknown base pairing information. In-depth evaluations demonstrate the capacity of our developed technique to identify true positive patterns and minimise false positives in comparison to existing methods. These findings provide strong evidence supporting the use of our approach for practical analysis towards uncovering structural elements contained within large genomic datasets.",1
Pulmonary sequelae in a patient recovered from swine flu,"

This paper examines the long-term pulmonary sequelae of severe swine flu in a patient who has recovered. Although it is well established that swine flu infection can cause significant acute respiratory illness, little is known about the chronic consequences in individuals affected. Our findings suggest that even if a full recovery from an episode of severe swine flu may be achieved over time, ongoing physiological changes to the lungs resulting from prior episodes remain with associated physiological and psychological impacts on general health and quality of life. The implications for clinical management are discussed.",1
Heme oxygenase-1 and carbon monoxide in pulmonary medicine,"Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), an inducible stress protein, confers cytoprotection against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo. In addition to its physiological role in heme degradation, HO-1 may influence a number of cellular processes, including growth, inflammation, and apoptosis. By virtue of anti-inflammatory effects, HO-1 limits tissue damage in response to proinflammatory stimuli and prevents allograft rejection after transplantation. The transcriptional upregulation of HO-1 responds to many agents, such as hypoxia, bacterial lipopolysaccharide, and reactive oxygen/nitrogen species. HO-1 and its constitutively expressed isozyme, heme oxygenase-2, catalyze the rate-limiting step in the conversion of heme to its metabolites, bilirubin IXα, ferrous iron, and carbon monoxide (CO). The mechanisms by which HO-1 provides protection most likely involve its enzymatic reaction products. Remarkably, administration of CO at low concentrations can substitute for HO-1 with respect to anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects, suggesting a role for CO as a key mediator of HO-1 function. Chronic, low-level, exogenous exposure to CO from cigarette smoking contributes to the importance of CO in pulmonary medicine. The implications of the HO-1/CO system in pulmonary diseases will be discussed in this review, with an emphasis on inflammatory states.",0
Development of a Plastic-Based Microfluidic Immunosensor Chip for Detection of H1N1 Influenza,"

This abstract outlines a study concerning the development of an innovative plastic-based microfluidic immunosensor chip (MICS) for detection of H1N1 influenza. This MICS was created using digital fabrication technologies and exhibits both cost-effectiveness and higher throughput rates than traditional methods used in antigen sensing assays. Despite its promising capabilities, the performance of this device still needs to be tested against complex biological matrices containing H1N1 antigens. Through optimization experiments involving surface properties, optimal antibody immobilization strategies and analysis parameters, this work provides valuable insight into how to further improve the overall operation of such biosensors for specific applications in health diagnostics.",1
The influence of locked nucleic acid residues on the thermodynamic properties of 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA heteroduplexes,"The influence of locked nucleic acid (LNA) residues on the thermodynamic properties of 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA heteroduplexes is reported. Optical melting studies indicate that LNA incorporated into an otherwise 2′-O-methyl RNA oligonucleotide usually, but not always, enhances the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA. Several trends are apparent, including: (i) a 3′ terminal U LNA and 5′ terminal LNAs are less stabilizing than interior and other 3′ terminal LNAs; (ii) most of the stability enhancement is achieved when LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2′-O-methyl nucleotide; and (iii) the effects of LNA substitutions are approximately additive when the LNA nucleotides are separated by at least one 2′-O-methyl nucleotide. An equation is proposed to approximate the stabilities of complementary duplexes formed with RNA when at least one 2′-O-methyl nucleotide separates LNA nucleotides. The sequence dependence of 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA duplexes appears to be similar to that of RNA/RNA duplexes, and preliminary nearest-neighbor free energy increments at 37°C are presented for 2′-O-methyl RNA/RNA duplexes. Internal mismatches with LNA nucleotides significantly destabilize duplexes with RNA.",0
Therapeutic Vaccination in Chronic Hepatitis B: Preclinical Studies in the Woodchuck,"Recommended treatment of chronic hepatitis B with interferon-α and/or nucleos(t)ide analogues does not lead to a satisfactory result. Induction of HBV-specific T cells by therapeutic vaccination or immunotherapies may be an innovative strategy to overcome virus persistence. Vaccination with commercially available HBV vaccines in patients did not result in effective control of HBV infection, suggesting that new formulations of therapeutic vaccines are needed. The woodchuck (Marmota monax) is a useful preclinical model for developing the new therapeutic approaches in chronic hepadnaviral infections. Several innovative approaches combining antiviral treatments with nucleos(t)ide analogues, DNA vaccines, and protein vaccines were tested in the woodchuck model. In this paper we summarize the available data concerning therapeutic immunization and gene therapy using recombinant viral vectors approaches in woodchucks, which show encouraging results. In addition, we present potential innovations in immunomodulatory strategies to be evaluated in this animal model.",0
A Pilot Study of Host Genetic Variants Associated with Influenza-associated Deaths among Children and Young Adults,"

This study presents a novel evaluation of host genetic variants in relation to the fatal outcome of influenza virus infections among children and young adults. Analyzing multiple independent cohorts, we performed epidemiologic and genetic analyses with the aim of characterizing gene-specific risks associated with severe influenza outcomes. Our investigation revealed 12 host genetic polymorphisms significantly associated with an increased risk for fatal outcomes after adjusting for other risk factors such as age, sex, pre-existing chronic medical condition, virulence markers, treatment regimens and year or birth cohort. This study provides preliminary insights on the potential role of human genetics variations conferring protection or increase susceptibilities to death from influenza infection among pediatric patients and young adults.",1
Globalization and emerging governance modalities,"This paper explores the possibilities for global governance effectively dealing with the international transmission of disease. First, zoonotic regulation and control pose a special case for public health agencies, and this paper proposes a propositional model for an effective public health stance. Second, globalization dynamics are briefly reviewed in terms of an emerging consensus on the need for global governance in public health. Third, a brief examination of global governance modalities suggests that a strong global governance case has distinct limitations (despite its possible justification); an exploration of contemporary directions in global governance follows. Finally, the paper examines the phenomenon of contemporary zoonotic control within the conditions of an effective regulatory regime.",0
Outdoor environments and human pathogens in air,"Are pathogens in outdoor air a health issue at present or will they become a problem in the future? A working group called AirPath - Outdoor Environments and Human Pathogens in Air was set up in 2007 at University College London, UK with the aim of opening new discussion and creating a research network to investigate the science and impacts of outdoor pathogens. Our objective in this paper is to review and discuss the following areas: What is the source of human pathogens in outdoor air? What current, developing and future techniques do we need? Can we identify at-risk groups in relation to their activities and environments? How do we prepare for the anticipated challenges of environmental change and new and emerging diseases? And how can we control for and prevent pathogens in outdoor environments? We think that this work can benefit the wider research community and policy makers by providing a concise overview of various research aspects and considerations which may be important to their work.",0
"Seasonal influenza vaccination knowledge, risk perception, health beliefs and vaccination behaviours of nurses","

This study explores the Seasonal Influenza Vaccination Knowledge, Risk Perception, Health Beliefs and Vaccination Behaviours of nurses. Amidst demands to reduce cost and maximize efficiency frequently questioning vaccines’ value due to potential risk associated with their usage, nurses are in a unique position providing healthcare services and information to individuals receiving the vaccine. This research investigates how nurse vaccination knowledge is related to specific health beliefs which might increase or decrease the intent to vaccinate against influenza virus annually. The results will provide an insight into what drives some nurses’ decision making on this issue; enabling health organisations more effectively target communications for increased vaccinations across vulnerable groups in winter season when her immunity could be compromised by various conditions including influenza virus.",1
Synthesis of an antiviral drug precursor from chitin using a saprophyte as a whole-cell catalyst,"

This paper presents a novel synthesis of an antiviral drug precursor from chitin, with the help of a saprophyte as a whole-cell catalyst. Chitin is widely available in nature and because of its thermal stability has been recognised as an environmentally friendly alternative to synthetic polymers. In this study, it was demonstrated that by using olivicolchine salt concentration alone or in combination with other reagents such as paraformaldehyde (PFA) and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), one can readily obtain satisfactory yields for synthesis of 5'-O-(2-methoxyethyl)-N-[(3R)-3-methylbutanoyl]uridine (MU). The unique contribution of this paper lies in the use of Lipomyces starkeyi imp6–1 mutant strain which serves simultaneously both as the grower organism for production of MU and also acts as an effective catalyst for improving the efficiency and yield up to 50%. Further optimisation studies are needed to make MU synthesis more cost efficient, yielding higher product quality with reduced environmental pollution.",1
Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN Polymorphisms Associated with Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis Infection," 

This journal article studies the association between Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN polymorphisms with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) infection. Through a comprehensive analysis of 200 patients suffering from IPA, researchers were able to determine the frequency of two genetic single nucleotide polymorphism variants relative to IPA diagnosis. It was observed that individuals with specific mutations in both Dectin-1 and DC-SIGN had an increased risk for developing IPA infection compared to those without these particular SNPs. This research demonstrates a crucial relationship between two gene loci carrying immunity related traits and susceptibility for IA infection, suggesting variation in individual responses against this fungi pathogen is linked to altered receptor activity levels leading to immune evasion or susceptibility resulting in systemic fungal aggression. The findings presented here can provide insights into immunological aspects of Aspergillus infections and could potentially assist towards improved prophylactic strategies against life threatening fungal pathogens like A. fumigatus seen in young adults and other vulnerable patient populations.",1
"Naturally-Occurring Genetic Variants in Human DC-SIGN Increase HIV-1 Capture, Cell-Transfer and Risk of Mother-To-Child Transmission","

This article presents a novel study on the effects of naturally-occurring genetic variants in human DC-SIGN (CD209), focusing specifically on their influence in increasing HIV-1 capture, cell transfer and risk of mother to child transmission. DC-SIGN is a C type lectin expressed by antigen presenting cells that plays an important role in innate immune responses and its role as gateway receptor for HIV has been extensively studied. However, while it has been speculated that germline polymorphism of this particular gene may affect HIV susceptibility, the reported studies have focused mainly on Asian populations. The present study thus set out to comprehensively analyze variation at this adapter molecule across various global regions from diverse Georgraphic backgrounds with special emphasis towards understanding its effect on disease progression with regards to MTC transmission. This evaluation is expected to contribute valuable insights into our knowledge regarding greater understanding of US patients' propensity towards different afflictions pertaining to AIDS/HIV virus spread thereby increasing measures directed towards curbing further disease dynamics helping manage high risk individuals worse affected during pandemics like Covid-19 epidemic prevailing today.",1
Lung tissue bioenergetics and caspase activity in rodents,"

This article provides an overview of the research exploring lung tissue bioenergetics and caspase activity in rodent models. Lung tissue is especially important for understanding issues such as pulmonary diseases, organ development and physiology due to its complex composition and non-replaceable function for oxygen processing. Caspases are key players in apoptosis or programmed cell death, providing critical functions during illness, injury or aging. Therefore, investigating their role in the context of lung biology and disease has great potential for advancing our knowledge about these processes. Our study explored how changes in caspase activity could be used to modulate lung behaviour through experimental protocols involving two rodent models: Rattus norvegicus (Norway rat) and Mus musculus (house mouse). Results from this experiment showed that increasing levels of caspase activity correlated with greater energy production associated with cellular maintenance while decreasing levels had a negative effect on energy balance. Furthermore, findings suggested that different species may have unique bioenergetic responses related to the modulation of metabolic pathways by specific pro-apoptotic enzymes such as those belonging to the family of caspases we studied here. Overall, this work will help guide future studies that are concerned with manipulating metabolic responses involved in apoptotic signalling cascades within various organs which can aid us better understand utilisation chain reactions at play when organisms become ill or age naturally.",1
Evolutionarily Conserved Herpesviral Protein Interaction Networks,"Herpesviruses constitute a family of large DNA viruses widely spread in vertebrates and causing a variety of different diseases. They possess dsDNA genomes ranging from 120 to 240 kbp encoding between 70 to 170 open reading frames. We previously reported the protein interaction networks of two herpesviruses, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). In this study, we systematically tested three additional herpesvirus species, herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1), murine cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus, for protein interactions in order to be able to perform a comparative analysis of all three herpesvirus subfamilies. We identified 735 interactions by genome-wide yeast-two-hybrid screens (Y2H), and, together with the interactomes of VZV and KSHV, included a total of 1,007 intraviral protein interactions in the analysis. Whereas a large number of interactions have not been reported previously, we were able to identify a core set of highly conserved protein interactions, like the interaction between HSV-1 UL33 with the nuclear egress proteins UL31/UL34. Interactions were conserved between orthologous proteins despite generally low sequence similarity, suggesting that function may be more conserved than sequence. By combining interactomes of different species we were able to systematically address the low coverage of the Y2H system and to extract biologically relevant interactions which were not evident from single species.",0
Unraveling the structural complexity in a single-stranded RNA tail: implications for efficient ligand binding in the prequeuosine riboswitch,"

This paper seeks to uncover the critical structural features of a single-stranded RNA tail that are essential for effective ligand binding by the prequeuosine riboswitch. Recent advances in NMR and biochemical techniques have enabled us to identify key elements involved in conformational changes associated with this regulatory element, yet relatively little is known about how specific tertiary motifs affect ligand recognition and binding efficiency. Drawing from an exhaustive analysis of three-dimensional structures, computer simulations, and kinetic measurements, we probe the energetic landscape in order to gain further insight into long-range communication between functionally important sites within these RNAs. Informed by our findings, we propose a mechanism for efficient ligand binding involving interplay between global conformation rearrangements at distant sites and local regulatory surface adjustments brought about through induced fit interactions upon base pairing with its target molecule or ions. Our research illuminates an unexplored area pertinent not only to elucidating principles behind riboregulation but also applications such as near infrared imaging agents (NIRIs).",1
Exposure of cats to low doses of FeLV: seroconversion as the sole parameter of infection,"In felids, feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection results in a variety of outcomes that range from abortive (virus readily eliminated and never detectable) to progressive infection (persistent viremia and viral shedding). Recently, a novel outcome was postulated for low FeLV infectious doses. Naïve cats exposed to faeces of persistently infected cats seroconverted, indicating infection, but remained negative for provirus and p27 antigen in blood. FeLV provirus was found in some tissues but not in the bone marrow, infection of which is usually considered a necessary stage for disease progression. To investigate the impact of low FeLV doses on young cats and to test the hypothesis that low dose exposure may lead to an unknown pathogenesis of infection without involvement of the bone marrow, 21 cats were infected oronasally with variable viral doses. Blood p27, proviral and viral loads were followed until week 20 post-infection. Tissue proviral loads were determined as well. The immune response was monitored by measuring FeLV whole virus and p45 antibodies; and feline oncornavirus-associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) assay. One cat showed regressive infection (transient antigenemia, persistent provirus-positivity, and seroconversion) with provirus only found in some organs at sacrifice. In 7 of the 20 remaining cats FOCMA assay positivity was the only sign of infection, while all other tests were negative. Overall, the results show that FeLV low dose exposure can result in seroconversion during a presumed abortive infection. Therefore, commonly used detection methods do not detect all FeLV-infected animals, possibly leading to an underestimation of the prevalence of infection.",0
Reflections on Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and the International Response,"Gabriel Leung and Angus Nicoll provide their reflections on the international response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, including what went well and what changes need to be made in anticipation of future flu pandemics.",0
Deletion of human metapneumovirus M2-2 increases mutation frequency and attenuates growth in hamsters,"BACKGROUND: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection can cause acute lower respiratory tract illness in infants, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. Currently there are no licensed preventative measures for hMPV infections. Using a variant of hMPV/NL/1/00 that does not require trypsin supplementation for growth in tissue culture, we deleted the M2-2 gene and evaluated the replication of rhMPV/ΔM2-2 virus in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: In vitro studies showed that the ablation of M2-2 increased the propensity for insertion of U nucleotides in poly-U tracts of the genomic RNA. In addition, viral transcription was up-regulated although the level of genomic RNA remained comparable to rhMPV. Thus, deletion of M2-2 alters the ratio between hMPV genome copies and transcripts. In vivo, rhMPV/ΔM2-2 was attenuated compared to rhMPV in the lungs and nasal turbinates of hamsters. Hamsters immunized with one dose of rhMPV/ΔM2-2 were protected from challenge with 10(6 )PFU of wild type (wt) hMPV/NL/1/00. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that hMPV M2-2 alters regulation of transcription and influences the fidelity of the polymerase complex during viral genome replication. In the hamster model, rhMPVΔM2-2 is attenuated and protective suggesting that deletion of M2-2 may result in a potential live vaccine candidate. A more thorough knowledge of the hMPV polymerase complex and the role of M2-2 during hMPV replication are being studied as we develop a potential live hMPV vaccine candidate that lacks M2-2 expression.",0
Marine Organism Cell Biology and Regulatory Sequence Discoveryin Comparative Functional Genomics,"

This article presents a comprehensive review of the impact of comparative functional genomics to better understand marine organism cells and elucidate their regulatory sequences. Specifically, previous work in process-oriented gene regulation has been used to discover patterns relevant to cell biology, clarify fundamental aspects of transcriptional control (e.g., basal complex networks and signaling pathways), as well as developing new insights into genome organization across multiple cellular compartments. We present detailed accounts on how this information augments our understanding of biological regulation in diverse taxa, while also providing valuable insight into general principles applicable beyond just one species or tissue type. Furthermore, this integrative framework enables us to recognize evolutionary trajectories defining long-term adaptation between various cell types at different anatomical levels. Additionally, from sequence analysis data obtained from these studies we can deduce interorganellar dependencies between genomic elements that manifest under specific physiological conditions or environmental cues; facilitating an increased capacity for discovering novel conserved motifs among marine organism genomes influencing interlinked physiological processes within these organisms via newly developed meta-analysis toolsets. It is clear that utilizing such integrative approaches will provide greater resolution for uncovering dynamic interactions shaping genetic makeup across various phyla; ultimately contributing towards a more nuanced approach towards mapping out global trends observed across trait–environment interface relationships using comparative functional genomics principles applied to marine organisms cell biology research programs worldwide.",1
Both TLR2 and TRIF Contribute to Interferon-β Production during Listeria Infection,"

This study investigates the roles of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and Toll/interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor inducing interferon-β (TRIF), two innate immune transmembrane proteins, during Listeria infection. The research established that TLR2 and TRIF both contribute to the production of interferon-β, a key cytokine in host defense against intracellular bacterial pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes. By evaluating changes in gene expression levels following treatment with either compound or both, this work presents new evidence for the integral role these receptors play in immune response to listerial invasion. Consequently, further understanding of their involvement may reveal potential drug targets for improving treatments against pathogenic infections by Listeria species.",1
"C-reactive protein, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A and pig major acute phase protein response in pigs simultaneously infected with H1N1 swine influenza virus and Pasteurella multocida","

This study investigates the response of four pig acute phase proteins (APP) to dual infection with H1N1 swine influenza virus (SIV) and Pasteurella multocida. Serological assays were carried out on more than 200 pigs divided into different groups receiving either SIV, P.multocida or a combination of both bacterial and viral matter in order to measure the app levels in blood serum pre-and post-infection. The results indicate that c-reactive protein, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A and major acute phase protein show distinct alterations depending on the type of infection received. 

The interplay between host immune response against pathogens is well known but much remains unknown about how organisms respond to multiple simultaneous infections mediated through diverse routes especially when virulence factors vary considerably among causative agents responsible for triggering inflammation cascade pathways leading several cooperative APP changes at once. To gain insight into this complexity, this paper attempts to provide evidence regarding whether proinflammatory apoplipoproteins similarly mount up a heightened defense efforts towards managing dual infection together or rather separately depending on precise immunostimulant configurations synthesized by cells engaging modulate molecular networks attempting to sequester challenge concurrently presented before an immune system overwhelmed by multiple aggregated assaults simultaneously occurring over time capable altering overall defensive strategies not discernible under single pathogen exposure events alone.",1
Tamiflu-Resistant but HA-Mediated Cell-to-Cell Transmission through Apical Membranes of Cell-Associated Influenza Viruses,"

This study presents the investigation into Tamiflu-resistant but HA-mediated cell-to-cell transmission through apical membranes of cell-associated influenza viruses. Influenza represents a major public health concern due to its potential for seasonal pandemics, causing wide scale morbidity and mortality. Given current strategies focus on infection control measures, antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu are mainly used in preventive and therapeutic treatments against infections caused by influenza virus strains previously known not to be resistant. However, several cases of high level resistance have been reported in recent years, leading to urgent research into alternative strategies for combating Tamiflu resistance. In this study we examined how tamiflu resistant influenza viruses are able to leverage host proteins such as Hemagglutinin (HA) protein mediators to enable the intercellular spread through apical membrane interactions with other cells harbouring resistive viral strains in close proximity which can then raise the possibility of successful transmission of our results should provide more data towards existing prevention techniques targeting high risk environments with knowledge regarding interventions that could limit further spread and persistence amongst hosts already infected with these immunoevasive variants thus safeguarding human populations from endemic or pandemic outbreaks caused by such closely interacting strains bearing tamiflu resistant properties..",1
Clinical use of exhaled volatile organic compounds in pulmonary diseases: a systematic review,"

This review aims to evaluate the clinical utility of exhaled volatile organic compounds (VOCs) for the early detection, prognosis and treatment monitoring of pulmonary diseases. Recent advances in breath analysis technology have enabled non-invasive diagnosis and management of respiratory illnesses, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and lung cancer. By investigating VOC concentrations in expelled air over time through a systematic review, this study seeks to establish whether they could be used as diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers of these common pulmonary diseases. A meta-analysis was also conducted to compare medical practice with various existing panels consisting of differentially expressed VOCs linked to each disease. Our findings suggest that novel metabolomics-based methods based on VOC concentration can help identify potential pathogenic signatures indicative of individual conditions, thereby enabling risk stratification among patients diagnosed with acute or chronic respiratory illness. Furthermore, recent evidence suggests that extracellular metabolites produced by the airway are closely associated with modest alterations in lung function and unique environmental exposure signatures which could enable personalized treatment strategies for better therapeutic outcomes. In conclusion, our data supports the clinical use of exhaled volatile organic compounds for optimal prevention and management protocols in order to improve patient care for individuals affected by pulmonary diseases across multiple settings.",1
Tylosema esculentum (Marama) Tuber and Bean Extracts Are Strong Antiviral Agents against Rotavirus Infection,"Tylosema esculentum (marama) beans and tubers are used as food, and traditional medicine against diarrhoea in Southern Africa. Rotaviruses (RVs) are a major cause of diarrhoea among infants, young children, immunocompromised people, and domesticated animals. Our work is first to determine anti-RV activity of marama bean and tuber ethanol and water extracts; in this case on intestinal enterocyte cells of human infant (H4), adult pig (CLAB) and adult bovine (CIEB) origin. Marama cotyledon ethanolic extract (MCE) and cotyledon water extract (MCW) without RV were not cytotoxic to all cells tested, while seed coat and tuber extracts showed variable levels of cytotoxicity. Marama cotyledon ethanolic and water extracts (MCE and MCW, resp.) (≥0.1 mg/mL), seed coat extract (MSCE) and seed coat water extract (MSCW) (0.01 to 0.001 mg/mL), especially ethanolic, significantly increased cell survival and enhanced survival to cytopathic effects of RV by at least 100% after in vitro co- and pre-incubation treatments. All marama extracts used significantly enhanced nitric oxide release from H4 cells and enhanced TER (Ω/cm(2)) of enterocyte barriers after coincubation with RV. Marama cotyledon and seed coat extracts inhibited virion infectivity possibly through interference with replication due to accumulation of nitric oxide. Marama extracts are therefore promising microbicides against RV.",0
General Practice and Pandemic Influenza: A Framework for Planning and Comparison of Plans in Five Countries,"BACKGROUND: Although primary health care, and in particular, general practice will be at the frontline in the response to pandemic influenza, there are no frameworks to guide systematic planning for this task or to appraise available plans for their relevance to general practice. We aimed to develop a framework that will facilitate planning for general practice, and used it to appraise pandemic plans from Australia, England, USA, New Zealand and Canada. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We adapted the Haddon matrix to develop the framework, populating its cells through a multi-method study that incorporated the peer-reviewed and grey literature, interviews with general practitioners, practice nurses and senior decision-makers, and desktop simulation exercises. We used the framework to analyse 89 publicly-available jurisdictional plans at similar managerial levels in the five countries. The framework identifies four functional domains: clinical care for influenza and other needs, public health responsibilities, the internal environment and the macro-environment of general practice. No plan addressed all four domains. Most plans either ignored or were sketchy about non-influenza clinical needs, and about the contribution of general practice to public health beyond surveillance. Collaborations between general practices were addressed in few plans, and inter-relationships with the broader health system, even less frequently. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to provide a framework to guide general practice planning for pandemic influenza. The framework helped identify critical shortcomings in available plans. Engaging general practice effectively in planning is challenging, particularly where governance structures for primary health care are weak. We identify implications for practice and for research.",0
The effect of network mixing patterns on epidemic dynamics and the efficacy of disease contact tracing,"In networks, nodes may preferentially contact other nodes with similar (assortatively mixed) or dissimilar (disassortatively mixed) numbers of contacts. Different patterns of contact support different epidemic dynamics, potentially affecting the efficacy of control measures such as contact tracing, which aims to identify and isolate nodes with infectious contacts. We used stochastic simulations to investigate the effects of mixing patterns on epidemic dynamics and contact-tracing efficacy. For uncontrolled epidemics, outbreaks occur at lower infection rates for more assortatively mixed networks, with faster initial epidemic growth rate and shorter epidemic duration than for disassortatively mixed networks. Contact tracing performs better for assortative mixing where epidemic size is large and tracing rate low, but it performs better for disassortative mixing at higher contact rates. For assortatively mixed networks, disease spreads first to highly connected nodes, but this is balanced by contact tracing quickly identifying these same nodes. The converse is true for disassortative mixing, where both disease and tracing are less likely to target highly connected nodes. For small epidemics, contact tracing is more effective on disassortative networks due to the greater resilience of assortative networks to link removal. Multi-step contact tracing is more effective than single-step tracing for assortative mixing, but this effect is smaller for disassortatively mixed networks.",0
Novel Paramyxoviruses in Free-Ranging European Bats,"

The recent years' emergence of a novel family of paramyxoviruses associated with bat populations worldwide is raising questions about their role in human-related disease burden. In this article, the authors provide a comprehensive overview of their findings on the presence and characteristics of novel paramyxoviruses carried by European bats. Following detailed literature review and exploratory field work using serum samples from 890 free-ranging bat species across four countries (Austria, Croatia, Hungary and Romania), it was revealed that 17 different types of novel paramyxovirus are ubiquitously present in European bats. Major differences were found between sites within each country regarding prevalence and type of virus detected among various species on site. This indicates that further surveillance activities should be suggested to further investigate the importance and impact of these viruses to both public health as well as local wildlife conservation efforts.",1
Pattern formation of an epidemic model with diffusion,"

This study presents a novel analysis of the pattern formation of an epidemic model with diffusion. We focus on how the topography of spatial density change, and develop a spatially explicit individual-based model to track the spread and progression of epidemics in two coupled habitat types. Through extensive simulations, we examine how the number and size distribution of patches evolves through time, ultimately leading to distinctive patterns across different scenarios. Our results reveal that epiphenomena like ""edge effects"" can measurably impact within-host dynamics, highlighting their potential impacts for disease transmission. These findings offer valuable insights into both understanding existing data sets involving multiple habitats as well as influencing future interventions directed towards reducing such outbreaks.",1
Analysis on the Pathogenesis of Symptomatic Pulmonary Embolism with Human Genomics," 

This paper presents an innovative analysis of the pathogenesis of symptomatic pulmonary embolism (PE) using human genomics. It is well-established that PE results from a combination of inherited or acquired thromboembolic risk factors and environmental influences, but there remains incomplete understanding of the pathways involved in this complex disorder. Through high-throughput genomic sequencing data combined with systems genetics approaches, we performed an integrative analysis to investigate the genetic regulation underlying symptomatic PE. Our findings indicate that distinct gene expression levels across various tissues can be implicated in developing the disease by modulating various protective mechanisms against its formation. In particular, our study suggests alterations in key genes associated with clotting and fibrinolysis play decisive roles within various cellular contexts for a variety of individuals with symptomatic PE. This research provides substantial insight towards furthering our understanding on how different complicating factors can contribute tosymptomatology asociated with this serious respiratory condition as well as bridges current medical knowledge gaps concerning its molecular underpinnings and paths toward potential treatments..",1
A Human PrM Antibody That Recognizes a Novel Cryptic Epitope on Dengue E Glycoprotein,"

This study presents an antibody that can specifically recognize a novel human-restricted cryptic epitope within the envelope (E) glycoprotein of Dengue virus. An extensive analysis based on molecular, immunological, and biochemical approaches was undertaken to characterize this specific monoclonal antibody obtained from murine hybridoma clone 6G1A6—the only one found to react with this putative epitope among 30 other prM-reactive antibodies generated by random screening. Superimposed onto 3D structural models and aided by mutagenesis experiments, our findings demonstrate the precise architecture of this hitherto unidentified cryptic epitope and confer great potential for its use as a diagnostic biomarker in both laboratory research studies and clinical settings.",1
TLR agonist–Stat3 siRNA conjugates: cell-specific gene silencing and enhanced antitumor immune responses,"Efficient delivery of siRNA to specific cell populations in vivo remains a formidable challenge to its successful therapeutic application. We describe a novel siRNA-based approach – synthetically linking siRNA to an oligonucleotide TLR9 agonist – that targets and silences genes in TLR9(+) myeloid cells and B cells, both of which are key components of the tumor microenvironment. Because Stat3 in tumor-associated immune cells suppresses antitumor immune responses and hinders TLR9-induced immune stimulation, we tested CpG-Stat3siRNA conjugates for anti-tumor effects. When injected locally at the tumor site or systemically through an intravenous route, the CpG-Stat3siRNA conjugates access tumor-associated dendritic cells, macrophages and B cells, inhibit Stat3 expression, leading to activation of tumor-associated immune cells, and ultimately potent anti-tumor immune responses. Our findings demonstrate the potential of TLR agonist-siRNA conjugates for targeted gene silencing coupled with TLR stimulation and immune activation in the tumor microenvironment.",0
Analysing the eosinophil cationic protein - a clue to the function of the eosinophil granulocyte,"Eosinophil granulocytes reside in respiratory mucosa including lungs, in the gastro-intestinal tract, and in lymphocyte associated organs, the thymus, lymph nodes and the spleen. In parasitic infections, atopic diseases such as atopic dermatitis and asthma, the numbers of the circulating eosinophils are frequently elevated. In conditions such as Hypereosinophilic Syndrome (HES) circulating eosinophil levels are even further raised. Although, eosinophils were identified more than hundred years ago, their roles in homeostasis and in disease still remain unclear. The most prominent feature of the eosinophils are their large secondary granules, each containing four basic proteins, the best known being the eosinophil cationic protein (ECP). This protein has been developed as a marker for eosinophilic disease and quantified in biological fluids including serum, bronchoalveolar lavage and nasal secretions. Elevated ECP levels are found in T helper lymphocyte type 2 (atopic) diseases such as allergic asthma and allergic rhinitis but also occasionally in other diseases such as bacterial sinusitis. ECP is a ribonuclease which has been attributed with cytotoxic, neurotoxic, fibrosis promoting and immune-regulatory functions. ECP regulates mucosal and immune cells and may directly act against helminth, bacterial and viral infections. The levels of ECP measured in disease in combination with the catalogue of known functions of the protein and its polymorphisms presented here will build a foundation for further speculations of the role of ECP, and ultimately the role of the eosinophil.",0
"Clinical Assessment and Improved Diagnosis of Bocavirus-induced Wheezing in Children, Finland","Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a widespread respiratory virus. To improve diagnostic methods, we conducted immunoglobulin (Ig) G and IgM enzyme immunoassays with recombinant virus–like particles of HBoV as antigen. Acute-phase and follow-up serum samples from 258 wheezing children and single serum samples from 115 healthy adults in Finland were examined. Our assays had a sensitivity of 97% and a specificity of 99.5%. Of adults, 96% had immunity; none had an acute infection. Of 48 children with serologically diagnosed acute HBoV infections, 45 were viremic and 35 had virus in nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs). Of 39 HBoV NPA PCR–positive children co-infected with another virus, 64% had a serologically verified HBoV infection. HBoV caused illness of longer duration than rhinovirus and of equal severity to that of respiratory syncytial virus. Among children with bronchiolitis, >25% had acute HBoV infections. Accurate HBoV diagnosis requires serologic analysis or PCR of serum; PCR of NPAs alone is insufficient.",0
Key Role of Splenic Myeloid DCs in the IFN-αβ Response to Adenoviruses In Vivo,"The early systemic production of interferon (IFN)-αβ is an essential component of the antiviral host defense mechanisms, but is also thought to contribute to the toxic side effects accompanying gene therapy with adenoviral vectors. Here we investigated the IFN-αβ response to human adenoviruses (Ads) in mice. By comparing the responses of normal, myeloid (m)DC- and plasmacytoid (p)DC-depleted mice and by measuring IFN-αβ mRNA expression in different organs and cells types, we show that in vivo, Ads elicit strong and rapid IFN-αβ production, almost exclusively in splenic mDCs. Using knockout mice, various strains of Ads (wild type, mutant and UV-inactivated) and MAP kinase inhibitors, we demonstrate that the Ad-induced IFN-αβ response does not require Toll-like receptors (TLR), known cytosolic sensors of RNA (RIG-I/MDA-5) and DNA (DAI) recognition and interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, but is dependent on viral endosomal escape, signaling via the MAP kinase SAPK/JNK and IRF-7. Furthermore, we show that Ads induce IFN-αβ and IL-6 in vivo by distinct pathways and confirm that IFN-αβ positively regulates the IL-6 response. Finally, by measuring TNF-α responses to LPS in Ad-infected wild type and IFN-αβR(−/−) mice, we show that IFN-αβ is the key mediator of Ad-induced hypersensitivity to LPS. These findings indicate that, like endosomal TLR signaling in pDCs, TLR-independent virus recognition in splenic mDCs can also produce a robust early IFN-αβ response, which is responsible for the bulk of IFN-αβ production induced by adenovirus in vivo. The signaling requirements are different from known TLR-dependent or cytosolic IFN-αβ induction mechanisms and suggest a novel cytosolic viral induction pathway. The hypersensitivity to components of the microbial flora and invading pathogens may in part explain the toxic side effects of adenoviral gene therapy and contribute to the pathogenesis of adenoviral disease.",0
Diagnosis and treatment of severe sepsis,"The burden of infection in industrialized countries has prompted considerable effort to improve the outcomes of patients with sepsis. This has been formalized through the Surviving Sepsis Campaign 'bundles', derived from the recommendations of 11 professional societies, which have promoted global improvement in those practices whose primary goal it is to reduce sepsis-related death. However, difficulties remain in implementing all of the procedures recommended by the experts, despite the apparent pragmatism of those procedures. We summarize the main proposals made by the Surviving Sepsis Campaign and focus on the difficulties associated with making a proper diagnosis and supplying adequate treatment promptly to septic patients.",0
Retrovirus Entry by Endocytosis and Cathepsin Proteases,"

This study presents a novel exploration into the molecular mechanisms that allow retroviruses to enter cells. Previously, it has been shown that entry of such viruses is largely achieved by endocytosis and fusion with acidic organelles in the host’s cell membrane. However, while this process is known to be catalyzed by specific proteases, how they are regulated remains unknown. This paper aims to elucidate on the role of particular cathepsin proteases in retrovirus entry by exploring their kinetic properties and affinity toward viral capsids during surface scanning events preceding viral fusion activities. Using documented data from extensive studies over the last decade as well as intensive laboratory-based examinations revolving around mutagenesis experiments, along with cutting edge computational tools for structure/function analysis; we aim to systematically analyze key elements contributing to efficient viral translocation across cellular membranes induced exclusively via endocytic pathways at both genetic and mechanistic levels. Our results will provide further insight into efficient delivery systems of therapeutic cargo based on highly selective uptake through clinical grade virus-like particles (VLPs).",1
Treatment of Neuroterrorism,"

This paper will explore the novel research and approaches to tackle the increasingly preeminent issue of neuroterrorism – terrorists who use psychological tactics to induce fear, manipulate individuals and propagate false information. In recent years, the diversifying forms of modern terrorism have necessitated a shift in our approach to treatment so that effective counter measures can be taken against this growing threat. This article focuses on existing methods as well as upcoming treatments for countering neuroterrorism. It reviews psychotherapeutic interventions such as Critical Incident Stress De-briefings (CISD) which focus on building resilience and harnessing social support networks in order to prevent reoccurring or recurring instances of terrorist attacks motivated by psychosocial power dynamics. Further developments outlined address how technology including internet platforms are being used engage heavily with affected populations. At present, there is a limited understanding of what constitutes successful therapies when treating victims or perpetrators of neurological trauma associated with political terroristic attacks therefore this review provides an essential foundation from which we can build evidence based strategies more tailored towards meeting the distinctive challenges posed by modernity's globalized climate where ideological warfare transcends physical boundaries .",1
Real Time Bayesian Estimation of the Epidemic Potential of Emerging Infectious Diseases,"BACKGROUND: Fast changes in human demographics worldwide, coupled with increased mobility, and modified land uses make the threat of emerging infectious diseases increasingly important. Currently there is worldwide alert for H5N1 avian influenza becoming as transmissible in humans as seasonal influenza, and potentially causing a pandemic of unprecedented proportions. Here we show how epidemiological surveillance data for emerging infectious diseases can be interpreted in real time to assess changes in transmissibility with quantified uncertainty, and to perform running time predictions of new cases and guide logistics allocations. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We develop an extension of standard epidemiological models, appropriate for emerging infectious diseases, that describes the probabilistic progression of case numbers due to the concurrent effects of (incipient) human transmission and multiple introductions from a reservoir. The model is cast in terms of surveillance observables and immediately suggests a simple graphical estimation procedure for the effective reproductive number R (mean number of cases generated by an infectious individual) of standard epidemics. For emerging infectious diseases, which typically show large relative case number fluctuations over time, we develop a Bayesian scheme for real time estimation of the probability distribution of the effective reproduction number and show how to use such inferences to formulate significance tests on future epidemiological observations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Violations of these significance tests define statistical anomalies that may signal changes in the epidemiology of emerging diseases and should trigger further field investigation. We apply the methodology to case data from World Health Organization reports to place bounds on the current transmissibility of H5N1 influenza in humans and establish a statistical basis for monitoring its evolution in real time.",0
Synthesis and biological activity of water-soluble polymer complexes of arbidol,"

This article outlines the findings of an investigative study conducted to analyze the synthesis and biological activity of water-soluble polymer complexes of arbidol as a new drug carrier for medical delivery. The research focused on synthesizing a novel form of arbidol - a broad-spectrum antiviral agent - utilizing water-soluble polymers in order to improve solubility, bioavailability, circulation time and stability while establishing potential therapeutic efficacy. Results were obtained through spectroscopic analysis, critical micelle concentration (CMC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and X-ray crystallography. Evaluating the cytotoxicity by means of MTT assay revealed no observable toxic effects when exposed to human liver carcinoma HepG2 cells and embryonic kidney 293Tcells at reduced concentrations introduced with natural physiological buffers providing an evidence that water soluble polymer complexes hold great promise for biopharmaceutical applications due to their good biocompatibility. 'Synthesis and Biological Activity of Water Soluble Polymer Complexes Of Arbidol': This article elucidates the successful synthesis, characterization and preliminary evaluation for their in vitro anti viral properties showing enhanced properties over unbound compound architectures which are promising indications against various diseases like influenza virus infections, offering robust platform starting point for preclinical investigations towards development as functional nanomedicines in humans.",1
Cost effective strategies for completing the Interactome,"Comprehensive protein interaction mapping projects are underway for many model species and humans. A key step in these projects is estimating the time, cost, and personnel required for obtaining an accurate and complete map. Here, we model the cost of interaction map completion across a spectrum of experimental designs. We show that current efforts may require up to 20 independent tests covering each protein pair to approach completion. We explore designs for reducing this cost substantially, including prioritization of protein pairs, probability thresholding, and interaction prediction. The best designs lower cost by four-fold overall and >100-fold in early stages of mapping. We demonstrate the best strategy in an ongoing project in Drosophila, in which we map 450 high-confidence interactions using 47 microtiter plates, versus thousands of plates expected using current designs. This study provides a framework for assessing the feasibility of interaction mapping projects and for future efforts to increase their efficiency.",0
New Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Therapeutic Strategies Based on the Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2/Angiotensin-(1–7)/Mas Receptor Axis,"

This paper aims to elucidate the potential therapeutic strategies of targeting Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2/Angiotensin-(1–7)/Mas receptor axis in combating cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. It has been recently revealed that this pathway not only plays significant roles in physiological functions, such as endothelial function and vascular remodelling, but also provides opportunities for precise treatments of a broad spectrum of disorders. Thus, identifying key components within the signalling cascade is pivotal to developing effective therapeutics for these illnesses. In order to achieve this goal, current experimental methods used both in vitro and in vivo studies are critically discussed with a view into understanding its complex relationships. This research will provide new insights into this pathway’s impact on pulmonology and cardiology allied health professionals drug development designs, while providing alternative therapies whereby individuals suffering from related conditions may benefit greatly.",1
ORMA: a tool for identification of species-specific variations in 16S rRNA gene and oligonucleotides design,"16S rRNA gene is one of the preferred targets for resolving species phylogenesis issues in microbiological-related contexts. However, the identification of single-nucleotide variations capable of distinguishing a sequence among a set of homologous ones can be problematic. Here we present ORMA (Oligonucleotide Retrieving for Molecular Applications), a set of scripts for discriminating positions search and for performing the selection of high-quality oligonucleotide probes to be used in molecular applications. Two assays based on Ligase Detection Reaction (LDR) are presented. First, a new set of probe pairs on cyanobacteria 16S rRNA sequences of 18 different species was compared to that of a previous study. Then, a set of LDR probe pairs for the discrimination of 13 pathogens contaminating bovine milk was evaluated. The software determined more than 100 candidate probe pairs per dataset, from more than 300 16S rRNA sequences, in less than 5 min. Results demonstrated how ORMA improved the performance of the LDR assay on cyanobacteria, correctly identifying 12 out of 14 samples, and allowed the perfect discrimination among the 13 milk pathogenic-related species. ORMA represents a significant improvement from other contexts where enzyme-based techniques have been employed on already known mutations of a single base or on entire subsequences.",0
Evaluation of Five Decontamination Methods for Filtering Facepiece Respirators,"Concerns have been raised regarding the availability of National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) during an influenza pandemic. One possible strategy to mitigate a respirator shortage is to reuse FFRs following a biological decontamination process to render infectious material on the FFR inactive. However, little data exist on the effects of decontamination methods on respirator integrity and performance. This study evaluated five decontamination methods [ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI), ethylene oxide, vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP), microwave oven irradiation, and bleach] using nine models of NIOSH-certified respirators (three models each of N95 FFRs, surgical N95 respirators, and P100 FFRs) to determine which methods should be considered for future research studies. Following treatment by each decontamination method, the FFRs were evaluated for changes in physical appearance, odor, and laboratory performance (filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance). Additional experiments (dry heat laboratory oven exposures, off-gassing, and FFR hydrophobicity) were subsequently conducted to better understand material properties and possible health risks to the respirator user following decontamination. However, this study did not assess the efficiency of the decontamination methods to inactivate viable microorganisms. Microwave oven irradiation melted samples from two FFR models. The remainder of the FFR samples that had been decontaminated had expected levels of filter aerosol penetration and filter airflow resistance. The scent of bleach remained noticeable following overnight drying and low levels of chlorine gas were found to off-gas from bleach-decontaminated FFRs when rehydrated with deionized water. UVGI, ethylene oxide (EtO), and VHP were found to be the most promising decontamination methods; however, concerns remain about the throughput capabilities for EtO and VHP. Further research is needed before any specific decontamination methods can be recommended.",0
Cancer Biomarker Discovery: The Entropic Hallmark,"BACKGROUND: It is a commonly accepted belief that cancer cells modify their transcriptional state during the progression of the disease. We propose that the progression of cancer cells towards malignant phenotypes can be efficiently tracked using high-throughput technologies that follow the gradual changes observed in the gene expression profiles by employing Shannon's mathematical theory of communication. Methods based on Information Theory can then quantify the divergence of cancer cells' transcriptional profiles from those of normally appearing cells of the originating tissues. The relevance of the proposed methods can be evaluated using microarray datasets available in the public domain but the method is in principle applicable to other high-throughput methods. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using melanoma and prostate cancer datasets we illustrate how it is possible to employ Shannon Entropy and the Jensen-Shannon divergence to trace the transcriptional changes progression of the disease. We establish how the variations of these two measures correlate with established biomarkers of cancer progression. The Information Theory measures allow us to identify novel biomarkers for both progressive and relatively more sudden transcriptional changes leading to malignant phenotypes. At the same time, the methodology was able to validate a large number of genes and processes that seem to be implicated in the progression of melanoma and prostate cancer. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We thus present a quantitative guiding rule, a new unifying hallmark of cancer: the cancer cell's transcriptome changes lead to measurable observed transitions of Normalized Shannon Entropy values (as measured by high-througput technologies). At the same time, tumor cells increment their divergence from the normal tissue profile increasing their disorder via creation of states that we might not directly measure. This unifying hallmark allows, via the the Jensen-Shannon divergence, to identify the arrow of time of the processes from the gene expression profiles, and helps to map the phenotypical and molecular hallmarks of specific cancer subtypes. The deep mathematical basis of the approach allows us to suggest that this principle is, hopefully, of general applicability for other diseases.",0
"Influenza activity in Europe during eight seasons (1999–2007): an evaluation of the indicators used to measure activity and an assessment of the timing, length and course of peak activity (spread) across Europe","BACKGROUND: The European Influenza Surveillance Scheme (EISS) has collected clinical and virological data on influenza since 1996 in an increasing number of countries. The EISS dataset was used to characterise important epidemiological features of influenza activity in Europe during eight winters (1999–2007). The following questions were addressed: 1) are the sentinel clinical reports a good measure of influenza activity? 2) how long is a typical influenza season in Europe? 3) is there a west-east and/or south-north course of peak activity ('spread') of influenza in Europe? METHODS: Influenza activity was measured by collecting data from sentinel general practitioners (GPs) and reports by national reference laboratories. The sentinel reports were first evaluated by comparing them to the laboratory reports and were then used to assess the timing and spread of influenza activity across Europe during eight seasons. RESULTS: We found a good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza collected by sentinel physicians (overall match of 72% for +/- 1 week difference). We also found a moderate to good match between the clinical sentinel data and laboratory reports of influenza from non-sentinel sources (overall match of 60% for +/- 1 week). There were no statistically significant differences between countries using ILI (influenza-like illness) or ARI (acute respiratory disease) as case definition. When looking at the peak-weeks of clinical activity, the average length of an influenza season in Europe was 15.6 weeks (median 15 weeks; range 12–19 weeks). Plotting the peak weeks of clinical influenza activity reported by sentinel GPs against the longitude or latitude of each country indicated that there was a west-east spread of peak activity (spread) of influenza across Europe in four winters (2001–2002, 2002–2003, 2003–2004 and 2004–2005) and a south-north spread in three winters (2001–2002, 2004–2005 and 2006–2007). CONCLUSION: We found that: 1) the clinical data reported by sentinel physicians is a valid indicator of influenza activity; 2) the length of influenza activity across the whole of Europe was surprisingly long, ranging from 12–19 weeks; 3) in 4 out of the 8 seasons, there was a west-east spread of influenza, in 3 seasons a south-north spread; not associated with type of dominant virus in those seasons.",0

Rift Valley Fever Virus NSs Protein Promotes Post-Transcriptional Downregulation of Protein Kinase PKR and Inhibits eIF2α Phosphorylation,"Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) (genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae) is a negative-stranded RNA virus with a tripartite genome. RVFV is transmitted by mosquitoes and causes fever and severe hemorrhagic illness among humans, and fever and high rates of abortions in livestock. A nonstructural RVFV NSs protein inhibits the transcription of host mRNAs, including interferon-β mRNA, and is a major virulence factor. The present study explored a novel function of the RVFV NSs protein by testing the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs gene in the presence of actinomycin D (ActD) or α-amanitin, both of which served as a surrogate of the host mRNA synthesis suppression function of the NSs. In the presence of the host-transcriptional inhibitors, the replication of RVFV lacking the NSs protein, but not that carrying NSs, induced double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)–mediated eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2α phosphorylation, leading to the suppression of host and viral protein translation. RVFV NSs promoted post-transcriptional downregulation of PKR early in the course of the infection and suppressed the phosphorylated eIF2α accumulation. These data suggested that a combination of RVFV replication and NSs-induced host transcriptional suppression induces PKR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation, while the NSs facilitates efficient viral translation by downregulating PKR and inhibiting PKR-mediated eIF2α phosphorylation. Thus, the two distinct functions of the NSs, i.e., the suppression of host transcription, including that of type I interferon mRNAs, and the downregulation of PKR, work together to prevent host innate antiviral functions, allowing efficient replication and survival of RVFV in infected mammalian hosts.",0
Eosinophilic infiltrate in a patient with severe Legionella pneumonia as a levofloxacin-related complication: a case report,INTRODUCTION: Legionella pneumonia can appear with different levels of severity and it can often present with complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome. CASE PRESENTATION: We report the case of a 44-year-old Caucasian man with Legionella pneumonia with successive development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. During his stay in intensive care the clinical and radiological situation of the previously observed acute respiratory distress syndrome unexpectedly worsened due to acute pulmonary eosinophilic infiltrate of iatrogenic origin. CONCLUSION: Levofloxacin treatment caused the occurrence of acute eosinophilic infiltrate. Diagnosis was possible following bronchoscopic examination using bronchoaspirate and transbronchial biopsy.,0
Cytomegalovirus infection in critically ill patients: a systematic review,"INTRODUCTION: The precise role of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection in contributing to outcomes in critically ill immunocompetent patients has not been fully defined. METHODS: Studies in which critically ill immunocompetent adults were monitored for CMV infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) were reviewed. RESULTS: CMV infection occurs in 0 to 36% of critically ill patients, mostly between 4 and 12 days after ICU admission. Potential risk factors for CMV infection include sepsis, requirement of mechanical ventilation, and transfusions. Prolonged mechanical ventilation (21 to 39 days vs. 13 to 24 days) and duration of ICU stay (33 to 69 days vs. 22 to 48 days) correlated significantly with a higher risk of CMV infection. Mortality rates in patients with CMV infection were higher in some but not all studies. Whether CMV produces febrile syndrome or end-organ disease directly in these patients is not known. CONCLUSIONS: CMV infection frequently occurs in critically ill immunocompetent patients and may be associated with poor outcomes. Further studies are warranted to identify subsets of patients who are likely to develop CMV infection and to determine the impact of antiviral agents on clinically meaningful outcomes in these patients.",0
Development of a large-scale isolation chamber system for the safe and humane care of medium-sized laboratory animals harboring infectious diseases,"The close phylogenetic relationship between humans and non-human primates makes non-human primates an irreplaceable model for the study of human infectious diseases. In this study, we describe the development of a large-scale automatic multi-functional isolation chamber for use with medium-sized laboratory animals carrying infectious diseases. The isolation chamber, including the transfer chain, disinfection chain, negative air pressure isolation system, animal welfare system, and the automated system, is designed to meet all biological safety standards. To create an internal chamber environment that is completely isolated from the exterior, variable frequency drive blowers are used in the air-intake and air-exhaust system, precisely controlling the filtered air flow and providing an air-barrier protection. A double door transfer port is used to transfer material between the interior of the isolation chamber and the outside. A peracetic acid sterilizer and its associated pipeline allow for complete disinfection of the isolation chamber. All of the isolation chamber parameters can be automatically controlled by a programmable computerized menu, allowing for work with different animals in different-sized cages depending on the research project. The large-scale multi-functional isolation chamber provides a useful and safe system for working with infectious medium-sized laboratory animals in high-level bio-safety laboratories.",0
Viral lower urinary tract infections,"

Lower urinary tract infections (UTIs) are caused when bacteria progress through the urethra and ascend into the bladder and can significantly impair quality of life. Viral UTIs present a significant challenge to clinicians as they share similar symptoms with bacterial UTIs without responding to antibiotic treatments. This review provides an in-depth examination of viral lower urinary tract infections, including epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis, management and prevention strategies. It is hoped that this article will provide current insights into understanding this condition so clinicians may improve their management techniques for those affected by these disabling conditions.",1
Establishment of a Reverse Genetics System for Studying Human Bocavirus in Human Airway Epithelia,"

This paper presents the first robust reverse genetics system for Human Bocavirus (HBoV), which has been of interest to virologists due to its role in causing a number of clinical conditions. Through exploitation of CRISPR/Cas9 technology, it is now possible to rapidly generate recombinant viruses and explore their potential pathogenic properties. In this study, a novel platform was developed that can introduce specific mutations into wild-type HBoV genome and test its effects on human airway epithelia models. Expression levels of attachment and entry factors in presence or absence of mutated pathogens were monitored using quantitative real-time PCR assemblies. A luciferase reporter system maintained by bicistronic reporters preconfigured with neomycin cassette and Renilla luciferase gene cassettes further demonstrated the stable packaging capacity of derived particles in vitro. This integrated approach allowed us to screen multiple parameters simultaneously under both replication competent or deficient regimes, demonstrating new insights into HBoV biology in terms of infectious factor expression dynamics in airway cells imported from humans ex vivo and cultured over extended timescales.",1
Pathogenesis of rotavirus-induced diarrhea: Preliminary studies in miniature swine piglet,"

This paper presents the preliminary findings of an ongoing study on the pathogenesis of rotavirus-induced diarrhea in miniature swine piglets. The effect of several enteric viruses, including rotavirus, on intestinal homeostasis and the host response to them has long been under investigation. The present study aims to evaluate if rotaviral pigs show any differences in severity or pathogenicity when compared with other infection models in this species. In a controlled experiment, 30 miniature swine piglets were administered orally with different levels of attenuated or wild-type virus strains and monitored for up to 28 days post-inoculation (pI). Histological observations along with serum samples collected pI and at weekly intervals demonstrated distinctive profiles between viral doses as well as responses between volunteers during the course of natural infections verses inoculated subjects over varied time periods following exposure. This research suggests that further studies should be conducted utilizing selective challenges towards elucidating microenvironmental signals, immunomodulatory patterns within peripheral lymphoid organs upon diversion while evaluating key pathways leading up to susceptibility versus resistance among multiple animal models involving avirulent versus virulent variations.",1
Lower Respiratory Tract Infection in a Renal Transplant Recipient: Do not Forget Metapneumovirus,"

This article examines the importance of diagnosing and treating metabolic pneumovirus (MPV) in renal transplant recipients who experience lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs). LRTI results due to MPV can be severe, often leading to serious complications such as organ rejection, a decreased response to immunosuppressive therapy or even death. Thus, it is essential that healthcare professionals become aware of the dangers posed by this virus and make adequate attempts to determine its presence within their patients. This paper looks at previous cases where MPV was found amongst renal transplant patients with an LRTI and defines key methods for diagnosing this virus based on these examples. Comprehensive diagnosis practices can help prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality associated with late detection or treatment failure of MPV among LRTI-suffering RTRs worldwide.",1
HIV-1 Fusion Is Blocked through Binding of GB Virus C E2D Peptides to the HIV-1 gp41 Disulfide Loop,"

This study provides evidence for HIV-1 fusion inhibition by a novel mechanism: the binding of GB Virus C E2D peptides to gp41 disulfide loop of HIV-1. Our findings demonstrate an unprecedented process, which is mediated by structural rearrangement and stabilization of the Env complex between glycoprotein 120 (gp120) and transmembrane glycoprotein 41 (GP41). This is achieved through rigidifying interactions between the GP41 disulphide loop and protective envelope (Env). Results from electron microscopy confirm that these interactions are crucial in inhibiting the oligomerization necessary for viral entry into host cells. Furthermore, computational analysis suggests that certain amino acid sequences present on GbV-C E2D peptides favourably shift entropic contributions and contribute to enhanced stability of the complex. Taken together, our research presents a new strategy with promising properties to limit or even stop human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transmission.",1
"Distinguishing Molecular Features and Clinical Characteristics of a Putative New Rhinovirus Species, Human Rhinovirus C (HRV C)","BACKGROUND: Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most frequently detected pathogens in acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and yet little is known about the prevalence, recurrence, structure and clinical impact of individual members. During 2007, the complete coding sequences of six previously unknown and highly divergent HRV strains were reported. To catalogue the molecular and clinical features distinguishing the divergent HRV strains, we undertook, for the first time, in silico analyses of all available polyprotein sequences and performed retrospective reviews of the medical records of cases in which variants of the prototype strain, HRV-QPM, had been detected. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: Genomic analyses revealed that the six divergent strains, residing within a clade we previously called HRV A2, had the shortest polyprotein of all picornaviruses investigated. Structure-based amino acid alignments identified conserved motifs shared among members of the genus Rhinovirus as well as substantive deletions and insertions unique to the divergent strains. Deletions mostly affected regions encoding proteins traditionally involved in antigenicity and serving as HRV and HEV receptor footprints. Because the HRV A2 strains cannot yet be cultured, we created homology models of predicted HRV-QPM structural proteins. In silico comparisons confirmed that HRV-QPM was most closely related to the major group HRVs. HRV-QPM was most frequently detected in infants with expiratory wheezing or persistent cough who had been admitted to hospital and required supplemental oxygen. It was the only virus detected in 65% of positive individuals. These observations contributed to an objective clinical impact ranging from mild to severe. CONCLUSIONS: The divergent strains did not meet classification requirements for any existing species of the genus Rhinovirus or Enterovirus. HRV A2 strains should be partitioned into at least one new species, putatively called Human rhinovirus C, populated by members detected with high frequency, from individuals with respiratory symptoms requiring hospital admission.",0
Common Variants in CDKN2B-AS1 Associated with Optic-Nerve Vulnerability of Glaucoma Identified by Genome-Wide Association Studies in Japanese,"

This article presents a genome-wide association study to identify common variants in CDKN2B-AS1, an antisense non-coding RNA that maps to the adjacent intron of the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 2B (CDKN2B) gene and is associated with optic nerve vulnerability in glaucoma. The comprehensive investigation was conducted among Japanese subjects and included diagnosis of 223 individuals with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG), 620 control participants from Japan Biobank, as well as 300 additional healthy controls from a US cohort. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported to associate Glaucoma were included for verification of genetic loci for POAG risk. Genotyping revealed significant association between one SNP rs7221196 on chromosome 6p21 and POAG susceptibility compared to both Japanese ethnically matched and ethnically diverse controls; however, other SNPs previously suggested to be involved in Glaucoma exacebration were not confirmed by this study. These results suggest that implications regarding optic nerve vulnerability in POAG may differ depending on ethnic background, which could prove valuable in future clinical applications specifically targeting Asian populations at risk for glaucomatous neovascularization.",1
Adaptive Contact Networks Change Effective Disease Infectiousness and Dynamics,"Human societies are organized in complex webs that are constantly reshaped by a social dynamic which is influenced by the information individuals have about others. Similarly, epidemic spreading may be affected by local information that makes individuals aware of the health status of their social contacts, allowing them to avoid contact with those infected and to remain in touch with the healthy. Here we study disease dynamics in finite populations in which infection occurs along the links of a dynamical contact network whose reshaping may be biased based on each individual's health status. We adopt some of the most widely used epidemiological models, investigating the impact of the reshaping of the contact network on the disease dynamics. We derive analytical results in the limit where network reshaping occurs much faster than disease spreading and demonstrate numerically that this limit extends to a much wider range of time scales than one might anticipate. Specifically, we show that from a population-level description, disease propagation in a quickly adapting network can be formulated equivalently as disease spreading on a well-mixed population but with a rescaled infectiousness. We find that for all models studied here – SI, SIS and SIR – the effective infectiousness of a disease depends on the population size, the number of infected in the population, and the capacity of healthy individuals to sever contacts with the infected. Importantly, we indicate how the use of available information hinders disease progression, either by reducing the average time required to eradicate a disease (in case recovery is possible), or by increasing the average time needed for a disease to spread to the entire population (in case recovery or immunity is impossible).",0
Blow Flies Were One of the Possible Candidates for Transmission of Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus during the 2004 Outbreaks in Japan,"

This review explores the potential transmission pathways for Highly Pathogenic (HP) H5N1 Avian Influenza Virus during its emergence in Japan in 2004. Through analysing available data, this paper concludes that Blow Flies were a credible candidate of infection vector. By highlighting the ecological and geographical minutiae associated with HP H5N1 virus, we aim to illustrate how considerably Blow Flies contributed to expanding this disease’s reach throughout Asia-Pacific region after original outbreak sites at poultry farms. This report derives information from literature already published on infection rises of HP H5N1 strain due to migratory birds as well as recent development considering transmission routes through insect vectors alongside domestic fowl rearing practices adopted by farming communities across Japan precluding incidents of reintroduction post control measures in place by 2005.",1

Retroviral Env Glycoprotein Trafficking and Incorporation into Virions,"

This paper presents new insights into the mechanism of retroviral Env glycoprotein trafficking and incorporation into virions. By using a combination of advanced imaging techniques, biochemical approaches and reverse genetics, we monitored distinct steps in protein transport from endoplasmic reticulum to plasma membrane as well as the integration of Env proteins into viral membranes during particle assembly. Our findings have revealed a novel pathway for organelle-spanning multimerization at late stages of viral entry that is necessary for efficient virus fusion with target cells via host cell surface receptors. Furthermore, this study has identified two compartments inside infected cells that are involved in Env glycoprotein trafficking namely post endosomes and recycling endosome. Ultimately, our results provide an enhanced understanding of how viruses subvert cellular energy sources to generate infectious particles capable of transmitting information between hosts efficiently for successful replication within their lifetime.",1

Proteolytic processing of a precursor protein for a growth-promoting peptide by a subtilisin serine protease in Arabidopsis,"Phytosulfokines (PSKs) are secreted, sulfated peptide hormones derived from larger prepropeptide precursors. Proteolytic processing of one of the precursors, AtPSK4, was demonstrated by cleavage of a preproAtPSK4–myc transgene product to AtPSK4–myc. Cleavage of proAtPSK4 was induced by placing root explants in tissue culture. The processing of proAtPSK4 was dependent on AtSBT1.1, a subtilisin-like serine protease, encoded by one of 56 subtilase genes in Arabidopsis. The gene encoding AtSBT1.1 was up-regulated following the transfer of root explants to tissue culture, suggesting that activation of the proteolytic machinery that cleaves proAtPSK4 is dependent on AtSBT1.1 expression. We also demonstrated that a fluorogenic peptide representing the putative subtilase recognition site in proAtPSK4 is cleaved in vitro by affinity-purified AtSBT1.1. An alanine scan through the recognition site peptide indicated that AtSBT1.1 is fairly specific for the AtPSK4 precursor. Thus, this peptide growth factor, which promotes callus formation in culture, is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor by a specific plant subtilase encoded by a gene that is up-regulated during the process of transfering root explants to tissue culture.",0
Protein Reporter Bioassay Systems for the Phenotypic Screening of Candidate Drugs: A Mouse Platform for Anti-Aging Drug Screening," 

This article explores the use of Protein Reporter Bioassay Systems as a new platform for anti-aging drug screening in mouse models. Protein Reporter Bioassays are immuno-reporter assays based on bioluminescent imaging that can detect biomarkers associated with aging and reveal how much these markers change during exposure to drug compounds. The objective of this study was to evaluate and compare the sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, reproducibility and cost-effectiveness of these systems in terms of detecting age-associated phenotypes. The data obtained from this approach could potentially open up novel therapeutic indices for developing effective personalized treatments against work diseases related to aging such as Alzheimer’s disease or cardiovascular disease, which have been proven difficult to tackle using current technology alone. Through both theoretical research and mice experiments, our assessment revealed that protein reporter bioassay systems are suitable for evaluating candidate drugs for anti-aging treatment across multiple organisms including mus musculus (mouse). Overall, we suggest that these systems utilized be used in future as an essential tool in preclinical screening studies where evaluation is required against large cohorts induced by various treatments at different ages or stages throughout life or conditions caused due to stressors due illness development through aging stage.",1
Ebola virus disease: any risk for oral and maxillo-facial surgery? An overview,"

The Ebolavirus Disease (EVD) has been a major global health concern for decades as it continues to cause serious illness and even death in some cases. This report investigates the potential risks posed by EVD for Oral and Maxillo-facial Surgery. By including evidence from a comprehensive literature search of pertinent studies, this overview aims to provide an updated assertion on what is known about the risk of EVD infection during oral and maxillofacial surgical interventions. A discussion of current recommended safety protocols are presented along with suggestions that may aid operative clinicians in making prudent decisions regarding their own practice. Understanding EVDs’s implications on oral surgery can potentially help surgeons make sound clinical judgements when assessing patients that would benefit from such treatment or perform necessary operations while managing patient concerns safely and reducing risk exposure among medical staff members involved in these tasks.",1
Host Modulators of H1N1 Cytopathogenicity,"

The novel H1N1 influenza virus re-emerged in 2009 and continues to cause substantial morbidity, mortality and economic losses worldwide. Understanding the nuances of its infection process has been a major focus for research communities over the past decade. This article investigates host modulators that act as crucial elements in regulating cytopathogenicity of H1N1 within human hosts. Using an integrated approach combining epidemiological modelling with widespread surveys across large populations, numerous physiological parameters have been evaluated using statistical models to determine their impact on overall disease severity. We present evidence that suggests dysregulation of several cytokines alongside aberrant immune responses influence the pathogenesis of H1N1 infection significantly. Furthermore, we discuss pharmacological interventions that might dampen this pro-inflammatory response while preserving essential T cell functions which govern protection against secondary infections or recurrence in newly infected individuals after recovery from primary infection.",1
Label-Free Electrochemical Diagnosis of Viral Antigens with Genetically Engineered Fusion Protein,"

This paper presents a novel methodology for label-free electrochemical diagnosis of viral antigens using genetically engineered fusion proteins. The method involves the combination of single protein domains with different recognition elements to create a unique cellulase/antibody hybrid enzyme. By targeting and bonding to specific antigen molecules, this hybrid enzyme can rapidly detect and distinguish viral antigens in samples without any additional labels or dyes. This study offers a major technical advance for disease diagnostics due to its potentials for point-of-care testing at low cost and high sensitivity. To validate the robustness of this new assay, multiple validation tests were carried out on five different pathogenic viruses showing good agreement with reference values in all cases. Overall, our findings demonstrate that this new label-free technique provides reliable data in an efficient manner necessary to enable outbreaks' monitoring at early stages while addressing the global needs in point-of care detection systems of infectious diseases.",1
Bacteriophage T7 morphogenesis and gene 10 frameshifting in Escherichia coli showing different degrees of ribosomal fidelity,"

This study examines the effects of bacteriophage T7 morphogenesis and frameshifting at gene 10 on ribosomal fidelity in Escherichia coli. Bacteria, one of the oldest forms of life, are continuously challenged by invading viruses known as phages. While some phages can be beneficial to bacteria, others such as T7 bring about changes that lead to localized infection or death for their hosts. We studied current literature describing potential impacts of T7 which is known to cause mutations via frameshifting following DNA replication in E.coli specifically at gene 10 located on the large chromosome. Results from our experiment show that change made with respect to rate-limiting energy generated during translation through shifts in ribosome structure varies depending upon local conditions encountered by the cell when under attack by T7 Abrupt transitions between open and closed states occurring through reorganization within affected parts of a given chromosome increase risks associated with misreading genetic code resulting in production of improperly broken down proteins leading eventually to disruption mutation profiles found within various segments making up bacterial genome showing different degrees of efficiency related particularly contrasting performances observed with respect universally accepted measures determining positional accuracy occur accordingly throughout densest collection mRNA codons present along strands hence used herein constrain sequence assembly existing definitive frame we hypothesized when specific thresholds become exceeded an increased number defective ca probiotic delivery systems able deliver compatible coatings engineered facilitate non pathogenic susceptibilities this metagenomes value demonstrated needs further research extend understanding functioning protein synthesis ribosometry discuss implications future development reactive pharmacological vectors potentially attenuation colonization strong pathogens elsewhere contributing general public health .",1
Lethal Nipah Virus Infection Induces Rapid Overexpression of CXCL10,"

The lethal Nipah virus, first identified in Malaysia in 1998 and now globalized, is a zoonotic pathogen for humans. This study focuses on the remarkable rapid over-expression of CXCL10—chemokine ligand 10—in individuals affected by the virus. Using cell culture models coupled with highly sensitive ELISA assays, we demonstrated that exposure to nipah mediated through silent transmission systems such as aerosols or respiratory secretions triggers cellular response pathways leading to increased production of CXCL10. Our results emphasize an urgent need to develop targeted therapies that target not only the Nipah virus but also this upregulated chemokine secretion pathway associated with fatal infection symptoms. We propose a prophylactic strategy combined with extensive vaccination programs which may reduce human exposure and deaths due to Nipah Virus Infection.",1
Hypoxia-regulated target genes implicated in tumor metastasis,"

Hypoxia, a state of reduced oxygen concentrations in the environment, has long been attributed to tumor progression and metastasis. In this study, we investigate the role of hypoxia-regulated target genes in these two processes. Using an innovative array-based technique we identified 15 target genes which were differentially expressed under low oxygen concentrations associated with tumor tissues compared to normal conditions. After further experimentation, it became evident that these targets are integral components of signal transduction pathways involved in cell proliferation, invasion and migration - core functions driving tumor progression and metastasis. We thus show that altering gene expression levels according to hypoxia could signal unfavorable conditions conducive to potentially malignant cells gain autonomy over their niche through uncontrolled growth and movement into other areas of the body leading to cancer spread.",1
Childhood Tuberculosis Presenting with Haemophagocytic Syndrome,"

This study examines the case of a six-year-old child with an atypical presentation of tuberculosis and associated haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS). The investigations showed that childhood tuberculosis in a low endemic country was complicated by HPS, transformed into macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) after immunosuppressive treatment. This paper aims to define the clinical features at diagnosis, discuss unconventional presentations and highlight management challenges for subspecialists treating MAS patients. Further research is required to identify genetic associations between MAS/HPS reactivation due to emerging primary infections such as tuberculous mycobacteria or other pathogens triggering TB‐like clinical manifestations.",1
Effects of Pulsed Electromagnetic Fields on Human Osteoblastlike Cells (MG-63): A Pilot Study,"BACKGROUND: Although pulsed electromagnetic fields (PEMFs) are used to treat delayed unions and nonunions, their mechanisms of action are not completely clear. However, PEMFs are known to affect the expression of certain genes. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We asked (1) whether PEMFs affect gene expression in human osteoblastlike cells (MG63) in vitro, and (2) whether and to what extent stimulation by PEMFs induce cell proliferation and differentiation in MG-63 cultures. METHODS: We cultured two groups of MG63 cells. One group was treated with PEMFs for 18 hours whereas the second was maintained in the same culture condition without PEMFs (control). Gene expression was evaluated throughout cDNA microarray analysis containing 19,000 genes spanning a substantial fraction of the human genome. RESULTS: PEMFs induced the upregulation of important genes related to bone formation (HOXA10, AKT1), genes at the transductional level (CALM1, P2RX7), genes for cytoskeletal components (FN1, VCL), and collagenous (COL1A2) and noncollagenous (SPARC) matrix components. However, PEMF induced downregulation of genes related to the degradation of extracellular matrix (MMP-11, DUSP4). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: PEMFs appear to induce cell proliferation and differentiation. Furthermore, PEMFs promote extracellular matrix production and mineralization while decreasing matrix degradation and absorption. Our data suggest specific mechanisms of the observed clinical effect of PEMFs, and thus specific approaches for use in regenerative medicine.",0

"Communicable Diseases Prioritized for Surveillance and Epidemiological Research: Results of a Standardized Prioritization Procedure in Germany, 2011","

This paper describes the results of standardized prioritization procedure utilized to identify communicable diseases for surveillance and epidemiological research in Germany, 2011. For this purpose, 51 diseases were assigned four risk factors including disease burden, infectivity rate, control measures available and implications for public health response. After evaluating these criteria using a multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool which was supported by evidentiary information from statistical databases and literature review, 8 diseases emerged as priority cases ranging briefly from tuberculosis to HIV/AIDS etc. This MCDA-based methodology could help allocate resources effectively providing a broader insight in terms of improving strategies concerned with infection control specifically in Germany. By adopting a systematic evidence-based approach it can contribute towards prioritizations of future threats.",1
Bayesian Phylogeography Finds Its Roots,"As a key factor in endemic and epidemic dynamics, the geographical distribution of viruses has been frequently interpreted in the light of their genetic histories. Unfortunately, inference of historical dispersal or migration patterns of viruses has mainly been restricted to model-free heuristic approaches that provide little insight into the temporal setting of the spatial dynamics. The introduction of probabilistic models of evolution, however, offers unique opportunities to engage in this statistical endeavor. Here we introduce a Bayesian framework for inference, visualization and hypothesis testing of phylogeographic history. By implementing character mapping in a Bayesian software that samples time-scaled phylogenies, we enable the reconstruction of timed viral dispersal patterns while accommodating phylogenetic uncertainty. Standard Markov model inference is extended with a stochastic search variable selection procedure that identifies the parsimonious descriptions of the diffusion process. In addition, we propose priors that can incorporate geographical sampling distributions or characterize alternative hypotheses about the spatial dynamics. To visualize the spatial and temporal information, we summarize inferences using virtual globe software. We describe how Bayesian phylogeography compares with previous parsimony analysis in the investigation of the influenza A H5N1 origin and H5N1 epidemiological linkage among sampling localities. Analysis of rabies in West African dog populations reveals how virus diffusion may enable endemic maintenance through continuous epidemic cycles. From these analyses, we conclude that our phylogeographic framework will make an important asset in molecular epidemiology that can be easily generalized to infer biogeogeography from genetic data for many organisms.",0
A Single Residue Substitution in the Receptor-Binding Domain of H5N1 Hemagglutinin Is Critical for Packaging into Pseudotyped Lentiviral Particles,"

The research paper, titled 'A Single Residue Substitution in the Receptor-Binding Domain of H5N1 Hemagglutinin Is Critical for Packaging into Pseudotyped Lentiviral Particles', presents an extensive evaluation resulting from a substitution mutation of the receptor-binding domain in avian influenza virus. By using genetic engineering techniques to substitute specific sites within the receptor binding domain, the researchers were able to identify and confer efficient pseudovirion packaging that can be used as a tool for vaccine development. This study outlines multiple observations conducted on lentivirus pseudotypes containing substituted strains of wild type or mutant haemagglutinin genes from conserving both vector capacity/functionality and antigenic properties desired for developing effective vaccines. Furthermore, it confirms how these pseudo viruses modified with a single residue substitution at 13 amino acids position located in HR2 region constitute rare finding that help explains how wide range polarizing substitutions are critical for maintaining viral functioning upon minimal changes . The conclusion of this analysis contributes important insights towards enhancing virus structure stability through small mutational modifications which will aid our understanding on following designs intended to improve functional capabilities upscaled production",1
"Hybridization properties of long nucleic acid probes for detection of variable target sequences, and development of a hybridization prediction algorithm","One of the main problems in nucleic acid-based techniques for detection of infectious agents, such as influenza viruses, is that of nucleic acid sequence variation. DNA probes, 70-nt long, some including the nucleotide analog deoxyribose-Inosine (dInosine), were analyzed for hybridization tolerance to different amounts and distributions of mismatching bases, e.g. synonymous mutations, in target DNA. Microsphere-linked 70-mer probes were hybridized in 3M TMAC buffer to biotinylated single-stranded (ss) DNA for subsequent analysis in a Luminex® system. When mismatches interrupted contiguous matching stretches of 6 nt or longer, it had a strong impact on hybridization. Contiguous matching stretches are more important than the same number of matching nucleotides separated by mismatches into several regions. dInosine, but not 5-nitroindole, substitutions at mismatching positions stabilized hybridization remarkably well, comparable to N (4-fold) wobbles in the same positions. In contrast to shorter probes, 70-nt probes with judiciously placed dInosine substitutions and/or wobble positions were remarkably mismatch tolerant, with preserved specificity. An algorithm, NucZip, was constructed to model the nucleation and zipping phases of hybridization, integrating both local and distant binding contributions. It predicted hybridization more exactly than previous algorithms, and has the potential to guide the design of variation-tolerant yet specific probes.",0
"Genomic Signatures of Strain Selection and Enhancement in Bacillus atrophaeus var. globigii, a Historical Biowarfare Simulant","BACKGROUND: Despite the decades-long use of Bacillus atrophaeus var. globigii (BG) as a simulant for biological warfare (BW) agents, knowledge of its genome composition is limited. Furthermore, the ability to differentiate signatures of deliberate adaptation and selection from natural variation is lacking for most bacterial agents. We characterized a lineage of BGwith a long history of use as a simulant for BW operations, focusing on classical bacteriological markers, metabolic profiling and whole-genome shotgun sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: Archival strains and two “present day” type strains were compared to simulant strains on different laboratory media. Several of the samples produced multiple colony morphotypes that differed from that of an archival isolate. To trace the microevolutionary history of these isolates, we obtained WGS data for several archival and present-day strains and morphotypes. Bacillus-wide phylogenetic analysis identified B. subtilis as the nearest neighbor to B. atrophaeus. The genome of B. atrophaeus is, on average, 86% identical to B. subtilis on the nucleotide level. WGS of variants revealed that several strains were mixed but highly related populations and uncovered a progressive accumulation of mutations among the “military” isolates. Metabolic profiling and microscopic examination of bacterial cultures revealed enhanced growth of “military” isolates on lactate-containing media, and showed that the “military” strains exhibited a hypersporulating phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our analysis revealed the genomic and phenotypic signatures of strain adaptation and deliberate selection for traits that were desirable in a simulant organism. Together, these results demonstrate the power of whole-genome and modern systems-level approaches to characterize microbial lineages to develop and validate forensic markers for strain discrimination and reveal signatures of deliberate adaptation.",0

Induction of GADD34 Is Necessary for dsRNA-Dependent Interferon-β Production and Participates in the Control of Chikungunya Virus Infection,"

“Induction of GADD34 Is Necessary for dsRNA-Dependent Interferon-β Production and Participates in the Control of Chikungunya Virus Infection” investigates how cellular proteins coordinate responses to chikungunya virus (CHIKV) infections. The growth kinetics and dynamics between CHIKVs and the host organism is complex; however, a specific type of protein known as GADD34 has emerged as particularly relevant. Using a combination of reverse genetics, biochemical assays, cell cultures, lentiviral expression technology and CRISPR/Cas9 engineering this study determined that induction of GADD34 facilitates viral sensing via an interferon signaling pathway upon recognition of double stranded RNA (dsRNA). Upon successful induction it was observed that GADD34 supports sustained antiviral efficacy through exacerbation of multiple viruses including CHIKV. Consequently these findings suggest that this studied protein could serve as novel drug target in order to create effective antiviral treatments for CHIKV infection.",1
Low-Cost HIV-1 Diagnosis and Quantification in Dried Blood Spots by Real Time PCR,"BACKGROUND: Rapid and cost-effective methods for HIV-1 diagnosis and viral load monitoring would greatly enhance the clinical management of HIV-1 infected adults and children in limited-resource settings. Recent recommendations to treat perinatally infected infants within the first year of life are feasible only if early diagnosis is routinely available. Dried blood spots (DBS) on filter paper are an easy and convenient way to collect and transport blood samples. A rapid and cost effective method to diagnose and quantify HIV-1 from DBS is urgently needed to facilitate early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and monitoring of antiretroviral therapy. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We have developed a real-time LightCycler (rtLC) PCR assay to detect and quantify HIV-1 from DBS. HIV-1 RNA extracted from DBS was amplified in a one-step, single-tube system using primers specific for long-terminal repeat sequences that are conserved across all HIV-1 clades. SYBR Green dye was used to quantify PCR amplicons and HIV-1 RNA copy numbers were determined from a standard curve generated using serially diluted known copies of HIV-1 RNA. This assay detected samples across clades, has a dynamic range of 5 log(10), and %CV <8% up to 4 log(10) dilution. Plasma HIV-1 RNA copy numbers obtained using this method correlated well with the Roche Ultrasensitive (r = 0.91) and branched DNA (r = 0.89) assays. The lower limit of detection (95%) was estimated to be 136 copies. The rtLC DBS assay was 2.5 fold rapid as well as 40-fold cheaper when compared to commercial assays. Adaptation of the assay into other real-time systems demonstrated similar performance. CONCLUSIONS: The accuracy, reliability, genotype inclusivity and affordability, along with the small volumes of blood required for the assay suggest that the rtLC DBS assay will be useful for early diagnosis and monitoring of pediatric HIV-1 infection in resource-limited settings.",0
Wearing face masks in public during the influenza season may reflect other positive hygiene practices in Japan,"

The purpose of this study is to identify if wearing face masks in public during the influenza season reflects other positive hygiene practices among adults in Japan. It has long been thought that the practice of wearing masks is a reflection of societal norms, with some perceiving it as an indication of heightened attention to hygiene. This study aims to analyze the correlations between mask use and habits such as frequent hand-washing or avoiding shared food items at meal times from adult survey respondents aged 20-65 within Nara prefecture in Japan over two different influenza seasons (2018/19 & 2019/20). Our results indicate that Japanese adults who reported regularly wearing a face covering also tended to report more positive hygienic behaviours than those who did not wear one. Furthermore, significant differences were observed during periods when influenza outbreaks are elevated compared to seasons without increased virus circulation. Thus these data serve as evidence that facial coverings may be related to greater awareness towards infection prevention measures among individuals in this particular area which can inform future health policy decisions relevant for similar locations particularly within periods when coronavirus begins circulating again throughout communities.

Viral Proteins Acquired from a Host Converge to Simplified Domain Architectures,"

Viruses have been rapidly evolving their protein architectures since the first identification facilitated by structural biology-based approaches. The objective of this paper is to investigate how viruses acquire complex functional protein domains from hosts during pathogenesis and through evolutionary processes, with a focus on discovering any simplification in the acquired architectures. Our research centers around answering two questions: (1) How do viruses obtain highly structured noncoding sequence elements from their host genomes? and (2) Does obtaining those novel structures converge towards more simplified designs over time? Through the use of robust modeling techniques based within molecular dynamics simulations, phylogenetic trees analysis & pattern recognition analysis we elucidate our suppositions about how proteins are acquired and subsequently adapted into modified domain structures. By utilizing numerous real world examples, as well as data gathered form multiple biological studies, such as genomics of virus-host interactions, results designate proteins gaining an architecture far simpler than what was formerly observed; displaying that viral design has not only advanced but be refined over tangible time periods. With findings further proving this phenomenon can be universally applied to all known families; Viral Proteins Acquired From a Host Converge To Simplified Domain Architectures promises intriguing implications surrounding the advancement in biochemical understanding within infective agents  enhancing future discourse between virologists in the effort towards combative treatments against deadly infectious diseases",1

The research team explored the potential of recombinant non-pathogenic Listeria innocua harboring vgc loci as an effective immunization strategy and how this novel vaccination could contribute to improved vaccine efficacy, specificity, and safety in humans. Research on mice demonstrated that the delivered inoculum conferred enhanced resistance to challenge with virulent strains of Listeria monocytogenes compared to conventional vaccines currently available. This promising result suggests that further development of this novel immunization technique could be highly beneficial for public health intervention strategies offering protection from listeriosis infection.",1
Immune Response to Lactobacillus plantarum Expressing Borrelia burgdorferi OspA Is Modulated by the Lipid Modification of the Antigen,"BACKGROUND: Over the past decade there has been increasing interest in the use of lactic acid bacteria as mucosal delivery vehicles for vaccine antigens, microbicides and therapeutics. We investigated the mechanism by which a mucosal vaccine based in recombinant lactic acid bacteria breaks the immunological tolerance of the gut in order to elicit a protective immune response. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We analyzed how the lipid modification of OspA affects the localization of the antigen in our delivery vehicle using a number of biochemistry techniques. Furthermore, we examined how OspA-expressing L. plantarum breaks the oral tolerance of the gut by stimulating human intestinal epithelial cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocyte derived dendritic cells and measuring cytokine production. We show that the leader peptide of OspA targets the protein to the cell envelope of L. plantarum, and it is responsible for protein export across the membrane. Mutation of the lipidation site in OspA redirects protein localization within the cell envelope. Further, we show that lipidated-OspA-expressing L. plantarum does not induce secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 by intestinal epithelial cells. In addition, it breaks oral tolerance of the gut via Th1/Th2 cell mediated immunity, as shown by the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by human dendritic cells, and by the production of IgG2a and IgG1 antibodies, respectively. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Lipid modification of OspA expressed in L. plantarum modulates the immune response to this antigen through a Th1/Th2 immune response.",0
Time-series analysis in imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia K562-cells under different drug treatments,"

Time-series analysis of imatinib-resistant chronic myeloid leukemia K562-cells under different drug treatments is an important research topic in the field of cancer biology. Imatinib, a targeted inhibitor, confers acquired resistance in K562 cells upon extended treatment against progressive human chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). In order to better understand the biological basis underlying such behaviour and study potential novel treatments to counter this effect, this research aims to observe the temporal evolution of gene expression levels following diverse treatments utilizing long time series data obtained from imatinib resistant CML K562 cell lines. The results generated by this technique will be compared with baseline states for each patient's original CML phenotype as well as other therapies employed on them. This comparison would provide insights regarding which drugs are most effective at treating the advanced stages of CML and preventing relapse. These valuable findings may accelerate progress towards developing a more refined personalized approach to anti-cancer therapy, thus providing essential assistance for medical practitioners struggling to improve quality of life for elderly or terminally ill patients requiring constant medication regimes and intensive monitoring regimens.",1
Severe Childhood Malaria Syndromes Defined by Plasma Proteome Profiles,"

This study examines the use of plasma proteome profiling to define severe childhood malaria syndromes. Recent advances in mass spectrometry and data analysis techniques have enabled comprehensive characterization of the proteins present in a biological sample, making proteomics an attractive strategy for accurate diagnosis and prognosis of disease states. This work is particularly relevant for diagnosing severe forms of malaria associated with high mortality rates among young children in endemic regions. We therefore analyzed baseline plasma samples from 80 acutely ill African children with highly-pathogenic Plasmodium falciparum infection, distinguishing between those with uncomplicated or complicated malaria syndromes using multi-parametric measurements composed by clinical features, hematological parameters and protein expression profiles derived from pyrosequencing assays prepared on blood spot cards. Our results demonstrate that it is feasible to identify unique plasma proteomes that are biomarkers for several severe malaria syndromes including cerebral malarial encephalopathy (CME). Furthermore, our findings underpin potential strategies for identifying more broadly defined subtypes relative to both demographic factors as well as other concurrent infections prevalent within these endemic populations.",1
A Statistical Framework for the Adaptive Management of Epidemiological Interventions,"BACKGROUND: Epidemiological interventions aim to control the spread of infectious disease through various mechanisms, each carrying a different associated cost. METHODOLOGY: We describe a flexible statistical framework for generating optimal epidemiological interventions that are designed to minimize the total expected cost of an emerging epidemic while simultaneously propagating uncertainty regarding the underlying disease model parameters through to the decision process. The strategies produced through this framework are adaptive: vaccination schedules are iteratively adjusted to reflect the anticipated trajectory of the epidemic given the current population state and updated parameter estimates. CONCLUSIONS: Using simulation studies based on a classic influenza outbreak, we demonstrate the advantages of adaptive interventions over non-adaptive ones, in terms of cost and resource efficiency, and robustness to model misspecification.",0
"Examining the knowledge, attitudes and practices of domestic and international university students towards seasonal and pandemic influenza","

This paper is about examining the knowledge, attitudes and practices of domestic and international university students towards seasonal and pandemic influenza. Research has suggested that university populations are at a high risk of contracting infectious diseases such as seasonal or pandemic influenza due to their close contact with international classmates, sharing of public areas and dormitories, lack of hygiene education, overcrowded living conditions, long hours spent indoors studying in libraries, etc. This research seeks to identify what domestic and international university students currently know about influenza viruses (both seasonal and pandemic), how they perceive it both personally as well as public health wise – what sort of preventive measures they practice both professionally (on-campus) and domestically; , whether or not they feel anxiety regarding an outbreak on campus; if different ethnicities/cultural backgrounds would alter these perceptions. The goal is to evaluate existing beliefs concerning flu vaccines so that better targeted strategies may be formulated for universities aiming to reduce their student population’s vulnerability from contracting any form of the virus in order to increase awareness levels during outbreaks - prevent transmission one person to another. Data will include semi-structured interviews with facial expressions among a representative sample size ranging from 1000 domestically stationed undergraduates across each state in Australia alongside other qualitative data gathered via an online survey targeting 500 international undergraduate exchange students based at three Universities - Monash University Malaysia, Murdoch University Dubai & Queensland University Singapore Campus over 6 months period..",1
Development of a Humanized Antibody with High Therapeutic Potential against Dengue Virus Type 2,"

This study presents the development of a humanized antibody for therapeutic potential against Dengue virus type 2 (DENV2). The research is based on an approach employing advanced molecular engineering techniques to modify IgG antibodies and optimize their binding affinity to viral antigens. We evaluated the efficacy of these engineered variants and determined their structural conformation using X-ray crystallography. The results show that despite possessing highly complex yet stable conformations, all four antibodies bind specifically to DENV2 antigen with nanomolar affinities, paving the way for novel clinical applications in areas such as control and prevention of chronic diseases caused by related virus strains. Meanwhile, we also measured antiviral activity endpoint assays whereby each variant demonstrated remarkable anti-viral potential in vivo with high precision. In conclusion, this work marks a major milestone in understanding DENV2 pathogenesis on detailed level and lays out evidence for elaborated vaccine design or immunotherapeutic drug formulation with improved potency against other related disease causing viruses.",1
"Recode-2: new design, new search tools, and many more genes","‘Recoding’ is a term used to describe non-standard read-out of the genetic code, and encompasses such phenomena as programmed ribosomal frameshifting, stop codon readthrough, selenocysteine insertion and translational bypassing. Although only a small proportion of genes utilize recoding in protein synthesis, accurate annotation of ‘recoded’ genes lags far behind annotation of ‘standard’ genes. In order to address this issue, provide a service to researchers in the field, and offer training data for developers of gene-annotation software, we have gathered together known cases of recoding within the Recode database. Recode-2 is an improved and updated version of the database. It provides access to detailed information on genes known to utilize translational recoding and allows complex search queries, browsing of recoding data and enhanced visualization of annotated sequence elements. At present, the Recode-2 database stores information on approximately 1500 genes that are known to utilize recoding in their expression—a factor of approximately three increase over the previous version of the database. Recode-2 is available at http://recode.ucc.ie",0
Dengue Virus Infection Perturbs Lipid Homeostasis in Infected Mosquito Cells," 

The dengue virus (DENV) is an arbovirus and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, largely due to its ability to cause severe clinical symptoms in humans. However, the means by which DENV exerts pathogenesis within infected cells remains poorly understood. In this study, we aimed to determine whether virus infection perturbs lipid metabolism in mosquito cell lines that act as vector hosts for the transmission cycle of DENV. Lipidomic analyses revealed drastically altered levels of lipids associated with DENV-infection, indicating dramatic disruption in cellular homeostasis caused by viral intrusion into mosquito cells. Collectively our findings provide insight on how infected mosquitoes may be metabolically handicapped during the acute stages of virus infection thus altering their capacity for transmitting arboviruses like DENV – an important factor contributing to epidemiology globally.

Quantitative Phosphoproteomics of Proteasome Inhibition in Multiple Myeloma Cells,"BACKGROUND: The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib represents an important advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM). Bortezomib inhibits the activity of the 26S proteasome and induces cell death in a variety of tumor cells; however, the mechanism of cytotoxicity is not well understood. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the differential phosphoproteome upon proteasome inhibition by using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) in combination with phosphoprotein enrichment and LC-MS/MS analysis. In total 233 phosphoproteins were identified and 72 phosphoproteins showed a 1.5-fold or greater change upon bortezomib treatment. The phosphoproteins with expression alterations encompass all major protein classes, including a large number of nucleic acid binding proteins. Site-specific phosphopeptide quantitation revealed that Ser38 phosphorylation on stathmin increased upon bortezomib treatment, suggesting new mechanisms associated to bortezomib-induced apoptosis in MM cells. Further studies demonstrated that stathmin phosphorylation profile was modified in response to bortezomib treatment and the regulation of stathmin by phosphorylation at specific Ser/Thr residues participated in the cellular response induced by bortezomib. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our systematic profiling of phosphorylation changes in response to bortezomib treatment not only advanced the global mechanistic understanding of the action of bortezomib on myeloma cells but also identified previously uncharacterized signaling proteins in myeloma cells.",0

Specifically, it elucidates how this process leads to a novel form of activation-induced apoptosis through ASK-1-dependent pathways. By elucidating molecular events during the binding and biochemical changes associated with cell death and signaling cascades, this paper promises insight into the basic physiological principles underlying DC homeostasis under viral invasion and immune regulation in health and disease states.

Design Novel Dual Agonists for Treating Type-2 Diabetes by Targeting Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptors with Core Hopping Approach,"

This study seeks to propose a dual agonist drug design approach for treating type-2 diabetes by targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) using core hopping. The burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing global public health problem due to the modern sedentary lifestyle and an unbalanced diet. Over recent decade, treatments including antidiabetic agents such as PPARγ agonists have been introduced in this scenario, yet durable therapeutic effects are mostly not achieved with long-term usage accompanied by unwanted toxic side effects. To address these challenges, here we present our concept of utilizing merotonic core hopping strategy for designing dual selective PPARγδ/α ligands using molecular docking simulations combined with the synergistic effect based pharmacophoric score analysis technique. Optimized compounds will be further tested in vitro systems before moving into tests on animal models due to their relatively specific binding profiles towards PPAR subtypes compared with traditional ligands or panagonists. Ultimately this research should contribute novel insights about how multi-drug treatment is more potent than single therapy against DM.",1
Electron Tomography Reveals the Steps in Filovirus Budding,"The filoviruses, Marburg and Ebola, are non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses causing severe hemorrhagic fever with high mortality rates in humans and nonhuman primates. The sequence of events that leads to release of filovirus particles from cells is poorly understood. Two contrasting mechanisms have been proposed, one proceeding via a “submarine-like” budding with the helical nucleocapsid emerging parallel to the plasma membrane, and the other via perpendicular “rocket-like” protrusion. Here we have infected cells with Marburg virus under BSL-4 containment conditions, and reconstructed the sequence of steps in the budding process in three dimensions using electron tomography of plastic-embedded cells. We find that highly infectious filamentous particles are released at early stages in infection. Budding proceeds via lateral association of intracellular nucleocapsid along its whole length with the plasma membrane, followed by rapid envelopment initiated at one end of the nucleocapsid, leading to a protruding intermediate. Scission results in local membrane instability at the rear of the virus. After prolonged infection, increased vesiculation of the plasma membrane correlates with changes in shape and infectivity of released viruses. Our observations demonstrate a cellular determinant of virus shape. They reconcile the contrasting models of filovirus budding and allow us to describe the sequence of events taking place during budding and release of Marburg virus. We propose that this represents a general sequence of events also followed by other filamentous and rod-shaped viruses.",0
Prolonged extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in a child affected by rituximab-resistant autoimmune hemolytic anemia: a case report,"INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune hemolytic anemia in children younger than 2 years of age is usually characterized by a severe course, with a mortality rate of approximately 10%. The prolonged immunosuppression following specific treatment may be associated with a high risk of developing severe infections. Recently, the use of monoclonal antibodies (rituximab) has allowed sustained remissions to be obtained in the majority of pediatric patients with refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia. CASE PRESENTATION: We describe the case of an 8-month-old Caucasian girl affected by a severe form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, which required continuous steroid treatment for 16 months. Thereafter, she received 4 weekly doses of rituximab (375 mg/m(2)/dose) associated with steroid therapy, which was then tapered over the subsequent 2 weeks. One month after the last dose of rrituximab, she presented with recurrence of severe hemolysis and received two more doses of rrituximab. The patient remained in clinical remission for 7 months, before presenting with a further relapse. An alternative heavy immunosuppressive therapy was administered combining cyclophosphamide 10 mg/kg/day for 10 days with methylprednisolone 40 mg/kg/day for 5 days, which was then tapered down over 3 weeks. While still on steroid therapy, the patient developed an interstitial pneumonia with Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, which required immediate admission to the intensive care unit where extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy was administered continuously for 37 days. At 16-month follow-up, the patient is alive and in good clinical condition, with no organ dysfunction, free from any immunosuppressive treatment and with a normal Hb level. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that aggressive combined immunosuppressive therapy may lead to a sustained complete remission in children with refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia. However, the severe life-threatening complication presented by our patient indicates that strict clinical monitoring must be vigilantly performed, that antimicrobial prophylaxis should always be considered and that experienced medical and nursing staff must be available, to deliver highly specialized supportive salvage therapies, if necessary, during intensive care monitoring.",0
Structural Origins for the Loss of Catalytic Activities of Bifunctional Human LTA4H Revealed through Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"

This article presents an in-depth study of the structural origins for the loss of catalytic activities in human leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H). Using advanced molecular dynamics simulations, this research offers a comprehensive investigation into how mutations at key sites lead to different functional outcomes and potential therapeutic strategies. Through a systematic analysis of mutation events in LTA4H, combined with essential biochemical properties, atomic force spectroscopy measurements and linear free energy relationships, the authors have developed predictive models that reveal realistic mechanisms associated with catalysis optimization and deactivation. This critical insight provides invaluable information for developing novel drugs targeting LTA4H enzyme activity related diseases such as asthma and allergies.",1
Using Support Vector Machine and Evolutionary Profiles to Predict Antifreeze Protein Sequences,"

This study introduces a newly developed method to predict and analyze Antifreeze Protein (AFP) sequence using Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Evolutionary Profiles. The source of AFPs is an important factor for the evaluation of these proteins' promotion as cryoprotectants, as many organisms living in subzero temperatures have adapted to their extreme environment by producing diverse variants of such molecules. We applied both SVM-based method and evolutionary profile analysis with back-propagation network toward the development of algorithms that can reliably assess related protein data and modeled this system against a comprehensive collection of known antifreeze sequences. Our results showed an improved accuracy rate on predicting AFP sequences relative to existing programs, thus offering greater insight into the characteristics behind these naturally occurring cold adaptors.",1
"Influenza in Refugees on the Thailand–Myanmar Border, May–October 2009","

This study presents an analysis of the prevalence of influenza amongst refugees on the Thailand-Myanmar border during the period May to October 2009. Through a survey and laboratory testing, we determined that among 1,082 registered refugee households, there were 270 cases (25%) ranging from mild symptoms of seasonal influenza A & B. Among those infected with influenza virus only 48 received adequate treatment consisting of antiviral medications, rest and fluids. The results suggest inadequate healthcare infrastructure for refugees in rural areas such as these without access to vaccinations or appropriate treatments for acute infections like influenza. Our findings highlight the need for increased focus on preventive healthcare measures among migrant populations living in conflict settings worldwide.",1
Prevalence of human herpesvirus 6 antibodies and DNA in allogeneic stem cell transplant patients: two-year single centre experience,"INTRODUCTION: Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) has been recognized as a potentially significant pathogen in hemopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Different clinical manifestations have been described, including fever, skin rash, bone marrow suppression, and encephalitis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective review of a group of 26 adult recipients of allogeneic HSCTs was conducted. Serum samples taken before transplant were examined for the presence of specific anti-HHV-6 IgM and IgG antibodies. After transplantation, quantitative real-time PCR was used to determine viral load in plasma samples from days 0–80 post-transplant. RESULTS: HHV-6 DNA was detected in plasma samples in 8 (30%) of the 26 recipients between days 18 and 40 after transplantation. All of them developed fever of unknown origin and over 50% had graft-versus-host disease features. Three individuals from this group died during detectable HHV-6 viremia. Another two recipients showed a single positive PCR result at a later time. Infection with HHV-6 was thus confirmed in 10 (38.5%) of the 26 graft recipients. CONCLUSIONS: There is a high frequency of detectable HHV-6 viral load in stem cell transplant recipients in Poland. Further investigation to monitor HHV-6 reactivation in graft recipients will be important to improve outcome for these patients.",0
Structural Optimization and De Novo Design of Dengue Virus Entry Inhibitory Peptides,"Viral fusogenic envelope proteins are important targets for the development of inhibitors of viral entry. We report an approach for the computational design of peptide inhibitors of the dengue 2 virus (DENV-2) envelope (E) protein using high-resolution structural data from a pre-entry dimeric form of the protein. By using predictive strategies together with computational optimization of binding “pseudoenergies”, we were able to design multiple peptide sequences that showed low micromolar viral entry inhibitory activity. The two most active peptides, DN57opt and 1OAN1, were designed to displace regions in the domain II hinge, and the first domain I/domain II beta sheet connection, respectively, and show fifty percent inhibitory concentrations of 8 and 7 µM respectively in a focus forming unit assay. The antiviral peptides were shown to interfere with virus:cell binding, interact directly with the E proteins and also cause changes to the viral surface using biolayer interferometry and cryo-electron microscopy, respectively. These peptides may be useful for characterization of intermediate states in the membrane fusion process, investigation of DENV receptor molecules, and as lead compounds for drug discovery.",0
Assessing the human immune system through blood transcriptomics,Blood is the pipeline of the immune system. Assessing changes in transcript abundance in blood on a genome-wide scale affords a comprehensive view of the status of the immune system in health and disease. This review summarizes the work that has used this approach to identify therapeutic targets and biomarker signatures in the field of autoimmunity and infectious disease. Recent technological and methodological advances that will carry the blood transcriptome research field forward are also discussed.,0
A multidimensional classification of public health activity in Australia,"BACKGROUND: At present, we have very limited ability to compare public health activity across jurisdictions and countries, or even to ascertain differences in what is considered to be a public health activity. Existing standardised health classifications do not capture important dimensions of public health, which include its functions, the methods and interventions used to achieve these, the health issues and determinants of health that public health activities address, the resources and infrastructure they use, and the settings in which they occur. A classification that describes these dimensions will promote consistency in collecting and reporting information about public health programs, expenditure, workforce and performance. This paper describes the development of an initial version of such a classification. METHODS: We used open-source Protégé software and published procedures to construct an ontology of public health, which forms the basis of the classification. We reviewed existing definitions of public health, descriptions of public health functions and classifications to develop the scope, domain, and multidimensional class structure of the ontology. These were then refined through a series of consultations with public health experts from across Australia, culminating in an initial classification framework. RESULTS: The public health classification consists of six top-level classes: public health 'Functions'; 'Health Issues'; 'Determinants of Health'; 'Settings'; 'Methods' of intervention; and 'Resources and Infrastructure'. Existing classifications (such as the international classifications of diseases, disability and functioning and external causes of injuries) can be used to further classify large parts of the classes 'Health Issues', 'Settings' and 'Resources and Infrastructure', while new subclass structures are proposed for the classes of public health 'Functions', 'Determinants of Health' and 'Interventions'. CONCLUSION: The public health classification captures the important dimensions of public health activity. It will facilitate the organisation of information so that it can be used to address questions relating to any of these dimensions, either singly or in combination. The authors encourage readers to use the classification, and to suggest improvements.",0
Bovine Chlamydophila spp. infection: Do we underestimate the impact on fertility?,"

Bovine Chlamydophila spp. infection has long been assumed to be a primary agent of infertility in dairy cows, but its actual significance as a major cause of bovine infertility within this particular species remains unclear. Despite the fact that clinical examination is commonly used to diagnose reproductive failure in female calves and commercial stock, the potential for an underlying bacterial etiology such as C. psittaci may have been underestimated due to its lengthy latency period before symptoms manifest.This study aimed at evaluating if Cpsittaci plays an important role in infertility issues among the subject population by performing serology-based diagnosis followed by PCR identification of both acute and latent infections caused by this agent for samples collected from suspect farms over 12 months across three states in India . The results suggest that roughly 8-17% of cases previously classified as unexplained or idiopathic fertility issues were actually driven by Cpssitacci infection, which represents a significant burden on animal health while also causing economic damage through lost production costs associated with infected cows unable to identify during milking seasons when their high value persists due to the premium placed upon heifers shown proficiency at lactating early. This study highlights that we can no longer ignore nor underestimate the importance placed upon preventative protocols meticulously followed and more regular testing schedules conducted across all areas of husbandry related products derived from these herds given our findings point toward delayed yet biologically relevant impact Chlamydia based agents could place upon affected dairies yields worldwide",1
"C. difficile 630Δerm Spo0A Regulates Sporulation, but Does Not Contribute to Toxin Production, by Direct High-Affinity Binding to Target DNA","

This study investigates the potential of antibiotic-resistant pathogen C. difficile 630Δerm Spo0A as a contributory factor in toxin production and sporulation. Through use of DNA pulldown assays and sequence analysis, we determined that while C. difficile 630Δerm Spo0A binds to target DNA with high affinity, it does not contribute to toxin production but can significantly influence sporulation rates. As such, this result demonstrates a unique role for antibiotic-resistant C. difficile 630Δerm Spo0A in regulating both the toxicity and spores produced by certain bacterial pathogens – providing a novel insight into mutational mechanisms driven by antibiotic selection pressures at play in their environments.",1
"RNA and DNA Bacteriophages as Molecular Diagnosis Controls in Clinical Virology: A Comprehensive Study of More than 45,000 Routine PCR Tests","Real-time PCR techniques are now commonly used for the detection of viral genomes in various human specimens and require for validation both external and internal controls (ECs and ICs). In particular, ICs added to clinical samples are necessary to monitor the extraction, reverse transcription, and amplification steps in order to detect false-negative results resulting from PCR-inhibition or errors in the technical procedure. Here, we performed a large scale evaluation of the use of bacteriophages as ICs in routine molecular diagnosis. This allowed to propose simple standardized procedures (i) to design specific ECs for both DNA and RNA viruses and (ii) to use T4 (DNA) or MS2 (RNA) phages as ICs in routine diagnosis. Various technical formats for using phages as ICs were optimised and validated. Subsequently, T4 and MS2 ICs were evaluated in routine real-time PCR or RT-PCR virological diagnostic tests, using a series of 8,950 clinical samples (representing 36 distinct specimen types) sent to our laboratory for the detection of a variety of DNA and RNA viruses. The frequency of inefficient detection of ICs was analyzed according to the nature of the sample. Inhibitors of enzymatic reactions were detected at high frequency in specific sample types such as heparinized blood and bone marrow (>70%), broncho-alveolar liquid (41%) and stools (36%). The use of T4 and MS2 phages as ICs proved to be cost-effective, flexible and adaptable to various technical procedures of real-time PCR detection in virology. It represents a valuable strategy for enhancing the quality of routine molecular diagnosis in laboratories that use in-house designed diagnostic systems, which can conveniently be associated to the use of specific synthetic ECs. The high rate of inhibitors observed in a variety of specimen types should stimulate the elaboration of improved technical protocols for the extraction and amplification of nucleic acids.",0
DNA Vaccines: Developing New Strategies against Cancer,"Due to their rapid and widespread development, DNA vaccines have entered into a variety of human clinical trials for vaccines against various diseases including cancer. Evidence that DNA vaccines are well tolerated and have an excellent safety profile proved to be of advantage as many clinical trials combines the first phase with the second, saving both time and money. It is clear from the results obtained in clinical trials that such DNA vaccines require much improvement in antigen expression and delivery methods to make them sufficiently effective in the clinic. Similarly, it is clear that additional strategies are required to activate effective immunity against poorly immunogenic tumor antigens. Engineering vaccine design for manipulating antigen presentation and processing pathways is one of the most important aspects that can be easily handled in the DNA vaccine technology. Several approaches have been investigated including DNA vaccine engineering, co-delivery of immunomodulatory molecules, safe routes of administration, prime-boost regimen and strategies to break the immunosuppressive networks mechanisms adopted by malignant cells to prevent immune cell function. Combined or single strategies to enhance the efficacy and immunogenicity of DNA vaccines are applied in completed and ongoing clinical trials, where the safety and tolerability of the DNA platform are substantiated. In this review on DNA vaccines, salient aspects on this topic going from basic research to the clinic are evaluated. Some representative DNA cancer vaccine studies are also discussed.",0
Discovery and Genomic Characterization of a Novel Ovine Partetravirus and a New Genotype of Bovine Partetravirus,"

This work presents a comprehensive study on the discovery and genomic characterization of a novel ovine partetravirus, coined OPV-1, along with a new genotype of bovine partetravirus (BPT-2). OPV-1 was identified in an industrial flock of sheep by conventional RT-PCR seeking evidence for known members belonging to the family Partitiviridae. Both viruses were then cloned and sequenced, while their full-length genomes compared against relevant taxa within GenBank allowed to establish that they corresponded to distinct agents as others had already suggested. The results obtained suggest that these two newly described viruses are gaining relevance as viable disease agents among animals maintained under production contexts subject to high biosecurity standards.

Replication enhancer elements within the open reading frame of tick-borne encephalitis virus and their evolution within the Flavivirus genus,"

This study examines the evolutionary mechanisms of replication enhancer elements within tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) as compared to other members of the Flavivirus genus. Through extensive in silico analysis, we investigated both the genomic location and sequence variability between closely related viruses to provide insight into the ancestral origin of these elements and how they are maintained through evolution. Using multiple bioinformatic tools, we were able to detect commonalities amongst core viral replicons that facilitate viral genome replication. Our work provides an overall overview of TBEV's replication enhancers at different phylogenetic scales as well as their functional significance for disease control efforts in conjunction with improved understanding of emerging flaviviruses. Moreover, our findings offer new insights on future vaccine design strategies and antigenicity generalization from a single host organism across various species in this diverse family.",1
An Epidemic Patchy Model with Entry–Exit Screening,"

This paper describes a novel epidemic patchy model with entry–exit screening. The model considers different environmental settings, such as urban or rural areas, and is capable of producing realistic scenarios of infection events by considering the individual's disease history over time together with environmental and geographic factors. To this aim, we propose an innovative approach that combines agent-based modeling techniques with stochastic dynamic programming to accurately track each individual’s exposure dynamics to emerging infectious diseases which are dependent on relevant socio-environmental parameters. Our results show that incorporation of entrance/exit control in addition to standard contact tracing can significantly reduce estimates based only off contact trace reporting for certain cases. This method provides policymakers valuable information regarding the effectiveness of detection and containment strategies when developing emergency preparedness plans for various environments .",1
"Travelling Companions: Emerging Diseases of People, Animals and Plants Along the Malawi-Mozambique Border","

This article investigates the emergence of diseases among people, animals, and plants at the border between Malawi and Mozambique. With increasingly long-distance travels in this region for trade, tourism, or migrations come new disease vectors that carry with them unprecedented risks to global health. This research analyses how risk assessment approaches can be used to identify pathogens as they cross borders, quantify contagion trends through syndromic surveillance systems, inform local communities on health precaution measures while travelling domestically or abroad, and empower public health workers in tracking infections across country lines. It will draw upon interviews conducted alongside existing secondary sources regarding travel habits at the border to create a clearer picture of how old and newly emerging viruses spread between different populations and within nations too often neglected by upper-level governments when it comes to their infectious disease preparedness. In sum, this paper seeks to provide sustainable solutions so those living near national borders can protect themselves from sudden outbreaks with effective aid from centralized medical authority structures.",1

Health System Resource Gaps and Associated Mortality from Pandemic Influenza across Six Asian Territories,"

This study examines the health system resource gaps across six Asian territories and their associated mortality from pandemic influenza. The severity of healthcare disparities between developed and developing countries has been further amplified by the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, highlighting the importance of this research in understanding regional differences in mortality due to inadequate pandemic preparation. By leveraging publicly available data sets including population size, income level, infectious disease-specific hospital bed capacity, government expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP, and cumulative deaths from four pandemics: H1N1 (2009), H5N1 (2005-2018), H7N9 (2013-2017) and 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) during January 2020–February 2021 over 6 low-, middle-, upper-middle to highincome countries or territories in Asia namely China mainland, Hong Kong SAR China or Taiwan Province China SARs; collectively referred to as 'Asian territories', this study aims to assess whether there are inequalities among different regions with respect to access to essential healthcare resources such as beds for critical care services and influence on mortality outcomes under similar circumstances. In summary, findings from this analysis shed light on potential resource gaps that exist across various Asian locations when it comes to providing adequate quality healthcare during a global health emergency.",1
Brain Transcriptome-Wide Screen for HIV-1 Nef Protein Interaction Partners Reveals Various Membrane-Associated Proteins,"

This study presents a verification of the identifying and categorizing essential elements of HIV-1 Nef protein interactions partners by means of transcriptome-wide screening. Through immunoisolation and western blot analysis, researchers collected a total of 11 membrane-associated proteins, including various vesicular trafficking components that are likely to bind directly to Nef protein in several human cell lines. Furthermore, this research applies an advanced technique known as SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) which is further evaluated through mass spectrometry platform technologies used earlier for other exogenous targets such as integral membrane proteins and GPCRs. Results demonstrate that viral infection regulates the expression levels of some tested candidates' molecules related to mitochondrial homeostasis and properties along with other closely associated cellular pathways. The results presented here provide valuable insight into therapeutic strategies against HIV infection using direct or indirect modulation on these promising nef protein interaction partner's activities specially those implicated at mitochondria level.",1

Superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation combined with continuous positive airway pressure/assisted spontaneous breathing improves oxygenation in patients with H1N1-associated ARDS,"

This paper presents the results of a clinical trial exploring how the combination of superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV) and continuous positive airway pressure/assisted spontaneous breathing (CPAP/ASB) improves oxygenation in patients with H1N1-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). At present, due to the lack of evidence and small sample sizes for efficacy analyses, there is controversy surrounding ventilatory management strategies for treating ARDS. Thus, we conducted this prospective controlled study to assess if our proposed intervention effects on oxygenation indexes can be enriched. Our findings indicated that combining SHFJV and CPAP/ASB could bring about significant improvements in arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2), PaO2/FiO2 ratio and PaCO2 level discrepancy compared to conventional mechanical ventilation alone. In conclusion, our research suggests that SHFJV combined with CPAP/ASB is an effective solution to improve hypoxemia in patients suffering from H1N1-associated ARDS.",1
The influence of climatic conditions on the transmission dynamics of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile,"

The transmission dynamics of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic in Chile was greatly influenced by climate conditions due to regional variation. This paper investigates how environmental parameters shaped the pattern of seasonal outbreaks and compare them to patterns prior to, during and post-pandemic and test continental predictions in a highly urbanized region like Chile. Using comprehensive cases from an outbreak surveillance system paired with climatic data, this study explores connections between infections' spread and meteorological derivatives covering a seven-year period (2009 - 2016). Logistic regression is used for hazard calculations providing valuable information about the evolution drivers outside population movement or human measures such as social distancing or vaccination rates. Results evidenced pronounced differences within July through March period temperatures increasing significantly risk at higher temperature range above 20°C while transmitting intensity decreased when arriving 27°C. Humidity had no effect on disease spreading rate during cold months yet delayed transmission when concentrated humidity reached 60% in summertime exceeding 40%. Findings suggested only short-term interactions ruling out current ability of models predicting long term epidemiological projections hence stressing environment relevance boosting sustainable public health interventions dealing with fall winter season disease pressure..",1
Tissue Tropism and Target Cells of NSs-Deleted Rift Valley Fever Virus in Live Immunodeficient Mice,"

This paper discusses the effects of eliminating the NSm segment from Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV) on its tissue tropism and target cells in a murine model. The study utilized an immunodeficient mouse for verifying these effects without interference from the host immune system. The results uncover new aspects surrounding RVFV pathogenesis, which can contribute to developing novel treatments targeted at this important human pathogen.
Tissue Tropism and Target Cells of NSs-Deleted Rift Valley Fever Virus in Live Immunodeficient Mice 
Rift Valley Fever virus (RVFV), a mosquitoborne flavivirus, is known to cause a wide range of clinical syndromes including fever, myalgia, vomiting and hemorrhagic disease resulting in significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. To investigate further its tissue tropism as well as identify infected cell targets, live immunocompromised mice were used since they provide an optimal setting under controlled laboratory environment with minimal influence from other factors such as differences among individuals’ adaptive immunity components. This paper elucidates the effect of deleting one genome segment encoding nonstructural protein 1 small subunit (NS1S) or NSm gene that behaves like virulence regulator on determining tissue tropism and target cells by RVFV strain 9000 recovered from East Africa isolates using CCID50 plaque forming units assay prior to inoculation into 7–8 week old SCID mice followed by histopathology assessment accordingly. The findings reported here may expand our knowledge on how infectious agents interact with their hosts leading up to optimizing therapeutic approaches against diseases caused by them moving forward.",1
Expression of anti-tumor recombinant IgG- and IgE-like genes in eukaryotic cells,"

This study evaluates the expression levels of two types of anti-tumor immunoglobulins, IgG and IgE, in eukaryotic cells. Through a series of experiments employing gene recombination techniques combined with genetic engineering and protein purification procedures, we sought to define their functional roles in cancer cell destruction. The purpose is to gain insights into how these molecules work together within complex cellular systems, such as cancerous lymphoma or leukemia tumors. Ultimately, this research could inform the development of novel therapies targeting both IgG- and IgE-mediated processes for future treatment applications.

Identification and Characterization of a Novel Non-Structural Protein of Bluetongue Virus,"

The Bluetongue Virus (BTV) is a double-stranded virus belonging to the genus Orbivirus of family Reoviridae and has been associated with large scale morbidity and mortality in both humans and livestock. BTV harbours several non-structural proteins that are typically released through viral proteolytic processing during its replication cycle, yet some remain uncharacterized. In this study, we identify and characterize a novel non-structural95 kDa protein of BTV using reverse genetics coupled with biochemical approaches such as mass spectrometry, SDS PAGE gel electrophoresis along with Western Blot analysis. The product of core gene 14 possesses two distinct domains — an NterminusU1A domain which exhibits prolyl tripeptide repeat motifs plus an RNA binding domain at the C terminus–which are believed to be important for mediating various functions in genome packaging and translational regulation. Furthermore, we reported evidence for augmented expression levels during relatively late stages of infection when compared to early timepoints; moreover its molecular weight varied according to laboratory strains demonstrating site-specific variants among isolates. These results provide novel insights into the biology as well as structural characteristics facilitating deeper understanding towards functional roles altogether critical for successful completion of viral life cycle. Overall our findings further establish potential utility in terms of diagnostics while drawing attention towards development potential vaccines targeting specifically this component amongst other major ones employed by bluetongue virus replicative machinery.

"Genetic Variation in the TNF Gene Is Associated with Susceptibility to Severe Sepsis, but Not with Mortality","

This study aims to investigate the potential association between genetic variation in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) gene and susceptibility to severe sepsis, as well as its influence on mortality outcomes. Severe sepsis is a major cause of death across all age groups, but controversies remain regarding its etiology and treatment. TNF has long been proposed as an effective pathogenic target for severe cases of this disease, however its role in the condition's development remains unclear. Through comprehensive genotyping and phenotypic evaluation of patient cohorts from two hospitals in Northeast China, we sought to establish a more definitive link between TNF variants and severe sepsis susceptibility —and their relative impact on morbidity costs— by confronting them with clinical records over an extended period of time. Our results revealed that there was indeed a significant correlation between individualSNPs in rs361525/rs1800629/rs1800750 and three haplotypes constructed using these sites simultaneously with severity levels stratified according to CURB-65 criteria; however there was no association found between those SNPs or haplotypes tested herein with patients' mortality outcome after adjusting for covariates suchinflammation markers concentrations.Furtherextensive studies are still neededto confirm our findings.",1
Mutational analysis of human CEACAM1: the potential of receptor polymorphism in increasing host susceptibility to bacterial infection,"A common overlapping site on the N-terminal IgV-like domain of human carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) is targeted by several important human respiratory pathogens. These include Neisseria meningitidis (Nm) and Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) that can cause disseminated or persistent localized infections. To define the precise structural features that determine the binding of distinct pathogens with CEACAMs, we have undertaken molecular modelling and mutation of the receptor molecules at previously implicated key target residues required for bacterial binding. These include Ser-32, Tyr-34, Val-39, Gln-44 and Gln-89, in addition to Ile-91, the primary docking site for the pathogens. Most, but not all, of these residues located adjacent to each other in a previous N-domain model of human CEACAM1, which was based on REI, CD2 and CD4. In the current studies, we have refined this model based on the mouse CEACAM1 crystal structure, and observe that all of the above residues form an exposed continuous binding region on the N-domain. Examination of the model also suggested that substitution of two of these residues 34 and 89 could affect the accessibility of Ile-91 for ligand binding. By introducing selected mutations at the positions 91, 34 and 89, we confirmed the primary importance of Ile-91 in all bacterial binding to CEACAM1 despite the inter- and intraspecies structural differences between the bacterial CEACAM-binding ligands. The studies further indicated that the efficiency of binding was significantly enhanced for specific strains by mutations such as Y34F and Q89N, which also altered the hierarchy of Nm versus Hi strain binding. These studies imply that distinct polymorphisms in human epithelial CEACAMs have the potential to decrease or increase the risk of infection by the receptor-targeting pathogens.",0
A Microarray Based Approach for the Identification of Common Foodborne Viruses,"An oligonucleotide array (microarray) incorporating 13,000 elements representing selected strains of hepatitis A virus (HAV), human coxsackieviruses A and B (CVA and CVB), genogroups I and II of Norovirus (NV), and human rotavirus (RV) gene segments 3,4,10, and 11 was designed based on the principle of tiling. Each oligonucleotide was 29 bases long, starting at every 5th base of every sequence, resulting in an overlap of 24 bases in two consecutive oligonucleotides. The applicability of the array for virus identification was examined using PCR amplified products from multiple HAV and CV strains. PCR products labeled with biotin were hybridized to the array, and the biotin was detected using a brief reaction with Cy3-labeled streptavidin, the array subjected to laser scanning, and the hybridization data plotted as fluorescence intensity against each oligonucleotide in the array. The combined signal intensities of all probes representing a particular strain of virus were calculated and plotted against all virus strains identified on a linear representation of the array. The profile of the total signal intensity identified the strain that is most likely represented in the amplified cDNA target. The results obtained with HAV and CV indicated that the hybridization profile thus generated can be used to identify closely related viral strains. This represents a significant improvement over current methods for virus identification using PCR amplification and amplicon sequencing.",0
Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 Risk for Frontline Health Care Workers,"

This project investigates the risk factors, consequences and surrounding circumstances associated with frontline health care workers (FHCWs) during pandemic H1N1 outbreak of 2009. Through a comprehensive study, we identify potential vulnerabilities of FHCWs and suggest possible countermeasures through an implementation system to enhance protection from contagion. Additionally, existing efforts at controlling the impact will be evaluated for their effective implementation in light of divergent national policies related to pandemic influenza preparedness. Our research focuses on socio-economic aspects while avoiding oversimplified approaches to protect healthcare personnel most at risk during such public health outbreaks. We argue that without further reinforcement or better regulations of safety protocols among those directly exposed to contagious material, adverse effects are likely to persist even long after an epidemic has subsided.",1
Multiplex cytokine profile from dengue patients: MIP-1beta and IFN-gamma as predictive factors for severity,"BACKGROUND: Dengue virus pathogenesis is not yet fully understood and the identification of patients at high risk for developing severe disease forms is still a great challenge in dengue patient care. During the present study, we evaluated prospectively the potential of cytokines present in plasma from patients with dengue in stratifying disease severity. METHODS: Seventeen-cytokine multiplex fluorescent microbead immunoassay was used for the simultaneous detection in 59 dengue patients. GLM models using bimodal or Gaussian family were determined in order to associate cytokines with clinical manifestations and laboratory diagnosis. RESULTS: IL-1β, IFN-γ, IL-4, IL-6, IL-13, IL-7 and GM-CSF were significantly increased in patients with severe clinical manifestations (severe dengue) when compared to mild disease forms (mild dengue). In contrast, increased MIP-1β levels were observed in patients with mild dengue. MIP-1β was also associated with CD56+NK cell circulating rates. IL-1β, IL-8, TNF-α and MCP-1 were associated with marked thrombocytopenia. Increased MCP-1 and GM-CSF levels correlated with hypotension. Moreover, MIP-1β and IFN-γ were independently associated with both dengue severity and disease outcome. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrated that the use of a multiple cytokine assay platform was suitable for identifying distinct cytokine profiles associated with the dengue clinical manifestations and severity. MIP-β is indicated for the first time as a good prognostic marker in contrast to IFN-γ that was associated with disease severity.",0
Stem–loop structures can effectively substitute for an RNA pseudoknot in −1 ribosomal frameshifting,"

This study explores the potential of stem–loop structures to substitute efficiently for an RNA pseudoknot in −1 ribosomal frameshifting, which is required by certain eukaryotic mRNAs to encode proteins. Frameshifting allows a reading frame change that enables translation from one open reading frame (ORF) into another. This has been linked with several important aspects of human physiology and pathology such as HIV, cancer and neuronal disease. The current study investigates if extended stem loops can possess sufficient structural flexibility, surpassing the energy threshold needed for ribosome movement during long downstream hops after expansion or contraction of secondary structure elements including helices and bulges along ORF boundaries in vivo. Results imply that larger stem–loops could effectively replace longer distance RNA pseudoknots at moderate cost under both physiologic temperatures and proper pH conditions.",1
"Neutrophil elastase, an acid-independent serine protease, facilitates reovirus uncoating and infection in U937 promonocyte cells","BACKGROUND: Mammalian reoviruses naturally infect their hosts through the enteric and respiratory tracts. During enteric infections, proteolysis of the reovirus outer capsid protein σ3 is mediated by pancreatic serine proteases. In contrast, the proteases critical for reovirus replication in the lung are unknown. Neutrophil elastase (NE) is an acid-independent, inflammatory serine protease predominantly expressed by neutrophils. In addition to its normal role in microbial defense, aberrant expression of NE has been implicated in the pathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Because reovirus replication in rodent lungs causes ARDS-like symptoms and induces an infiltration of neutrophils, we investigated the capacity of NE to promote reovirus virion uncoating. RESULTS: The human promonocyte cell line U937 expresses NE. Treatment of U937 cells with the broad-spectrum cysteine-protease inhibitor E64 [trans-epoxysuccinyl-L-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane] and with agents that increase vesicular pH did not inhibit reovirus replication. Even when these inhibitors were used in combination, reovirus replicated to significant yields, indicating that an acid-independent non-cysteine protease was capable of mediating reovirus uncoating in U937 cell cultures. To identify the protease(s) responsible, U937 cells were treated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), an agent that induces cellular differentiation and results in decreased expression of acid-independent serine proteases, including NE and cathepsin (Cat) G. In the presence of E64, reovirus did not replicate efficiently in PMA-treated cells. To directly assess the role of NE in reovirus infection of U937 cells, we examined viral growth in the presence of N-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val chloromethylketone, a NE-specific inhibitor. Reovirus replication in the presence of E64 was significantly reduced by treatment of cells with the NE inhibitor. Incubation of virions with purified NE resulted in the generation of infectious subviron particles that did not require additional intracellular proteolysis. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that NE can facilitate reovirus infection. The fact that it does so in the presence of agents that raise vesicular pH supports a model in which the requirement for acidic pH during infection reflects the conditions required for optimal protease activity. The capacity of reovirus to exploit NE may impact viral replication in the lung and other tissues during natural infections.",0
"Influence of genetic variability at the surfactant proteins A and D in community-acquired pneumonia: a prospective, observational, genetic study","

This paper sets out to determine the influence of genetic variability at the surfactant proteins A and D in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). CAP is a severe pulmonary illness that is among the top 10 leading causes of mortality worldwide, influencing more than 27 million people each year. The current treatments for CAP are becoming increasingly less effective as resistance evolves alongside changes in environmental conditions and bacterial strains. To address this important issue, we conducted a prospective observational genetic study over 18 months across six Medical Centers to ascertain any associations between genetic variants related to SURF1A and SURF1D genes – both crucial for equilibrium within surfactant levels in alveolar macrophages - and disease susceptibility or severity. We analyzed data acquired from 436 individuals diagnosed with CAP, including theirs demographic histories such as age or gender, as well as complete blood counts and statistical analysis on cells collected by bronchoalverovsular lavage technique during admission period; results were compared against those obtained fromcontrol group comprising 517 healthy participants matched through age brackets. Our analyses revealed evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms  located near or within 5’ regulatory regions SURFA though SURFD could predispose patients towards lower protection against airborne pathogens encountered while living in urban environment characterized by air pollution, extreme temperature variations or heavy metal intoxication; these effects seemed even bigger when combined with other medical condition like obesity or diabetes onset. Further research needs be carried out validate these findings so facts may found most suitable strategies provide stronger prevention epidemiologic evolving diverse microbialscenarioes seen urban settings today's world.",1
Analysis of synonymous codon usage and evolution of begomoviruses,"Begomoviruses are single-stranded DNA viruses and cause severe diseases in major crop plants worldwide. Based on current genome sequence analyses, we found that synonymous codon usage variations in the protein-coding genes of begomoviruses are mainly influenced by mutation bias. Base composition analysis suggested that the codon usage bias of AV1 and BV1 genes is significant and their expressions are high. Fourteen codons were determined as translational optimal ones according to the comparison of codon usage patterns between highly and lowly expressed genes. Interestingly the codon usages between begomoviruses from the Old and the New Worlds are apparently different, which supports the idea that the bipartite begomoviruses of the New World might originate from bipartite ones of the Old World, whereas the latter evolve from the Old World monopartite begomoviruses.",0
Membrane Fusion and Cell Entry of XMRV Are pH-Independent and Modulated by the Envelope Glycoprotein's Cytoplasmic Tail,"

This paper examines the pH-independent membrane fusion and cell entry of XMRV, a virus implicated in some human diseases, as well as describing how such process is directed by the glycoprotein's cytoplasmic tail embedded in its envelope. Various techniques were employed to determine the preferences for acidic and basic conditions among different types of viruses. The research conducted revealed that particular discrepancies between XMRV and other members of its family are due to modifications in their respective glycoproteins’ cytoplasmic tails which permit them to become highly independent from external pH variations for configuring intracellular fusion processes – a feature not seen across many related species previously known. This paper articulates how pH independence relies on complex dynamics propelled by proteins' multiple dynamical adaptations at varying external ion concentrations and further postulate possible implications it may have for understanding urgent medical challenges surrounding this important group of pathogenic agents.",1
Positional Bias of MHC Class I Restricted T-Cell Epitopes in Viral Antigens Is Likely due to a Bias in Conservation,"

This paper examines the possible significance of positional bias for MHC Class I restricted T-cell epitopes which are present within viral antigens. Recent findings indicate that particular sites in a given antigen may be more receptive to MHC binding and thus T-cell recognition. In comparison, other positions remain unbound by most alleles and consequently can provide no immune response. Our research found evidence of highly conservative parts across various viruses leading us to suggest that preeminent conservation likely facilitates favorable interactions with MHC molecules allowing these areas heightened accessibility. This study presents findings shedding light onto the importance of conserved regions determined on a virus’ global sequence level and their interrelation with successful presentation by its human host, relevant for development targeted immunotherapies against viral infections as well as upon evaluations regarding an optimal choice for vaccine design strategies.",1
"LoFreq: a sequence-quality aware, ultra-sensitive variant caller for uncovering cell-population heterogeneity from high-throughput sequencing datasets","

This paper presents LoFreq, a novel variant caller designed to research cell-population heterogeneity from high-throughput sequencing datasets. This tool adopts an innovative approach that accounts for both sequence quality and read depth. It is an ultra-sensitive algorithm, capable of detecting extremely rare variants with low allele frequencies even in the presence of a large majority population. Through comprehensive simulations and real-world validation studies on whole exome sequencing data sets with known ground truth, we demonstrate that LoFreq significantly outperforms all modern existing methods by simultaneously maximizing sensitivity, precision and accuracy without compromising control of false discovery rate or requiring substantial additional computational resources. Moreover, our tool offers heightened ability in identifying cellular subclones within any samples while preserving pyrosequencing accuracy levels using phred scores alone to identify sites where reads should be discarded due to excessive noise or discordant information from surrounding regions. The performance results obtained validate the proposed approach as a reliable solution for uncovering subtle differences between complex cell-populations at unprecedented analytical resolution capability so far not achievable by other competing packages available today.",1

Hepatitis C virus NS4A inhibits cap-dependent and the viral IRES-mediated translation through interacting with eukaryotic elongation factor 1A,"

This study explores the effect of Hepatitis C virus (HCV) NS4A on cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation efficiency. HCV is a major cause of liver cancer, yet its exact mechanism(s) of inhibition remain largely unknown. This work aims to investigate the function of HCV NS4A in affecting translation efficiency by assessing its interaction with eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A), demonstrating how it can alter viral infectivity at a post-initiation step. Through combined biochemical and virological approaches, we aim to uncover the underlying molecular basis by which HCV NS4A and eEF1a suppress mRNA translation initiation. The results could open up new opportunities for potential therapeutic intervention against this important human pathogen.",1
A New Model for Hendra Virus Encephalitis in the Mouse,"

This article presents an innovative approach to modelling Hendra virus encephalitis in mice, a highly contagious and often lethal disease with significant public health implications. By combining detailed biophysical parameters for protein folding with computer simulation techniques, our research team has developed a novel model that captures changes in the central nervous system caused by viral infection over time. This model sheds light on potential paths of pathogenesis, providing insight into specific molecular interactions implicated in neuron damage within this zoonotic disease. We have increased the predictive power of investigations by conducting a series of experiments that characterize both the effects of wild-type and mutant alleles on HVE progression in mice. Our findings suggest new strategies for prevention and treatment regimens that may be explored further as viable alternatives to extant control methods targeting this important family of viruses.",1
Rapid Identification of Malaria Vaccine Candidates Based on α-Helical Coiled Coil Protein Motif,"To identify malaria antigens for vaccine development, we selected α-helical coiled coil domains of proteins predicted to be present in the parasite erythrocytic stage. The corresponding synthetic peptides are expected to mimic structurally “native” epitopes. Indeed the 95 chemically synthesized peptides were all specifically recognized by human immune sera, though at various prevalence. Peptide specific antibodies were obtained both by affinity-purification from malaria immune sera and by immunization of mice. These antibodies did not show significant cross reactions, i.e., they were specific for the original peptide, reacted with native parasite proteins in infected erythrocytes and several were active in inhibiting in vitro parasite growth. Circular dichroism studies indicated that the selected peptides assumed partial or high α-helical content. Thus, we demonstrate that the bioinformatics/chemical synthesis approach described here can lead to the rapid identification of molecules which target biologically active antibodies, thus identifying suitable vaccine candidates. This strategy can be, in principle, extended to vaccine discovery in a wide range of other pathogens.",0
Synergistic Roles of Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factors 1Bγ and 1A in Stimulation of Tombusvirus Minus-Strand Synthesis,"

This study seeks to explore the Synergistic Roles of Eukaryotic Translation Elongation Factors 1Bγ and 1A in Stimulation of Tombusvirus Minus-Strand Synthesis. This cellular process is activated by numerous complexes, each responsible for various steps within viral replication. Recent studies have identified eEF1Bγ and eEF1A as two key elongation factors with critical impacts on minus-strand synthesis. Using a combination of biochemical analysis, accumulation assays and genetic testing this research aims to investigate how these proteins interact synergistically during tombusvirus DNA synthesis to promote efficient virus propagation both in vitro and in vivo. The outcomes will allow us to elucidate more fully the roles of eukaryotic translation elongation factors during RNA replication, facilitating further understanding into disease pathways connected with tombusviruses.",1

"The Dynamics, Causes and Possible Prevention of Hepatitis E Outbreaks","

This paper investigates the effects of a rising incidence and prevalence of Hepatitis E across different countries. It also explores possible causes that have been linked to such outbreaks, as well as examining the dynamics behind them. Finally, it identifies potential prevention strategies for containing any more future instances. The study used in-depth interviews from public health specialists and utilized medical records from 6 different affected countries to gather qualitative and quantitative data respectively. In order to better understand trends in hepatitis E occurrence rates following an outbreak, logistic regression models were employed over a period of 5 years through surveillance networks set up during this time period. Findings suggest that certain factors such as unhygienic conditions and contamination can lead to increases in reported cases of hepatitis E among vulnerable populations within certain geographical areas or communities with inadequate access to water sources; these results are discussed further alongside propositions for better management practices on both individual level and institutional level contexts towards preventing similar incidents in the future",1
Transmissibility and temporal changes of 2009 pH1N1 pandemic during summer and fall/winter waves,"

The 2009 pandemic of influenza A (H1N1) virus, known as ‘swine flu’, initiated in North America and spread rapidly throughout the rest of world. To understand transmission dynamics of this virus, temporal changes in transmission during the summer and fall/winter waves are needed. This study evaluated transmissibility and temporal changes of 2009 pH1N1 pandemic during different periods across 218 countries to determine underlying epidemiological factors contributing to its prevalence over time. Data on a range of demographic features such as population size, mobility trend and age structure were utilized for statistical analysis by capture-recapture equation G log linear model through monthly aggregation over 9 months between April to December in each country-year combination with confidence intervals constructed using likelihood uncertainty estimation framework within frequentist approach using sampling with replacement technique for bootstraping data sample size. The findings demonstrate that there is an increasing pattern indicating significant impact from PH1N1 spreading occurring mainly towards end of winter season affected mainly by overcrowding coupled with diminished hygiene practices leading to higher chances if infection becoming endemic regions especially amongst outskirt rural areas necessitating nationwide governmental interventions promptly dispatchable resources along collective efforts coming together meaningfully surpass shortcoming limitations prevails upon prolonged presence viral strain during peaks period epidemics wave originated influenza stemming penetration en masse seasonality which could potentially provide insight decision makers proactive measures anticipate intensive effective countermeasures put forth early before spreading progressed deadliest depths jeopardize populace vulnerable return surviving vanquished adversity possessing itself harm might unfold civilization future prevent ill effects ruin would wreak .

Immunogenetic Mechanisms Driving Norovirus GII.4 Antigenic Variation,"

The emergence of norovirus GII.4 as one of the predominant causative agents of gastroenteritis has compelled researchers to gain insights into its immunogenetic mechanisms. This article presents a comprehensive overview and evaluation of current research outlining how antigenic variation contributes to the viral evolution and spread globally. Through employing advanced molecular immunological techniques, it is proposed that norovirus GII.4 utilises a combination of genetic rearrangement and mutability strategies, allowing antigenic diversity which results in recurrent pandemics despite herd immunity among human populations. Further analysis explores potential implications for treatment approaches, highlighting promising new avenues such as antibody-based interventions to target multiple mutations while taking into account varying local outbreaks. The need for constant vigilance amongst healthcare practitioners is also addressed, by discussing ways in which monitoring of both regional patterns and antigenic characterization can lead to improved identification practices when managing associated clinical cases tied with this virus type",1
Ventilatory and ECMO treatment of H1N1-induced severe respiratory failure: results of an Italian referral ECMO center,"BACKGROUND: Since the first outbreak of a respiratory illness caused by H1N1 virus in Mexico, several reports have described the need of intensive care or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) assistance in young and often healthy patients. Here we describe our experience in H1N1-induced ARDS using both ventilation strategy and ECMO assistance. METHODS: Following Italian Ministry of Health instructions, an Emergency Service was established at the Careggi Teaching Hospital (Florence, Italy) for the novel pandemic influenza. From Sept 09 to Jan 10, all patients admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Emergency Department with ARDS due to H1N1 infection were studied. All ECMO treatments were veno-venous. H1N1 infection was confirmed by PCR assayed on pharyngeal swab, subglottic aspiration and bronchoalveolar lavage. Lung pathology was evaluated daily by lung ultrasound (LUS) examination. RESULTS: A total of 12 patients were studied: 7 underwent ECMO treatment, and 5 responded to protective mechanical ventilation. Two patients had co-infection by Legionella Pneumophila. One woman was pregnant. In our series, PCR from bronchoalveolar lavage had a 100% sensitivity compared to 75% from pharyngeal swab samples. The routine use of LUS limited the number of chest X-ray examinations and decreased transportation to radiology for CT-scan, increasing patient safety and avoiding the transitory disconnection from ventilator. No major complications occurred during ECMO treatments. In three cases, bleeding from vascular access sites due to heparin infusion required blood transfusions. Overall mortality rate was 8.3%. CONCLUSIONS: In our experience, early ECMO assistance resulted safe and feasible, considering the life threatening condition, in H1N1-induced ARDS. Lung ultrasound is an effective mean for daily assessment of ARDS patients.",0
Missing and accounted for: gaps and areas of wealth in the public health review literature,"

This article examines the gaps and areas of wealth in public health studies by surveying the current published literature. The study utilizes an extensive review of relevant material to identify critical elements that have been overlooked or inadequately addressed, thus uncovering opportunities for further exploration. Focusing on areas such as access to care and health literacy, this analysis provides a comprehensive overview of existing research and indicates where additional evaluation is necessary. In addition, it suggests ways to enhance the quality of future investigations through targeted interventions at each stage of the literature cycle: from concept development to publication; and from review board assessment through data collection/analysis/interpretation and reporting/communication dissemination. With specific regard to gender disparities in reporting one finds a notable absence; wherein contributions by evidence-based publications are not being seen as widely throughout disparate communities yielding an altogether inadequate representation across settings of practice. Ultimately it is incumbent upon both researchers and academic institutions alike taking accountability within their respective spheres while establishing standards appropriate to social determinants so that efficient utilization be had relative effectuating tangible solutions with viable redress outcomes in public health worldwide.",1
Brain Microbial Populations in HIV/AIDS: α-Proteobacteria Predominate Independent of Host Immune Status," 

With the advent of new sequencing technology, modern science has sought to understand how environmental bacterial composition can affect human health. This paper presents findings on the microbial populations existing in brains of HIV/AIDS patients that could potentially inform treatment protocols for this group. Using 16S ribosomal RNA and next generation sequencing (NGS), the authors analyzed brain tissue samples taken from 111 HIV/AIDS patients with varying CD4 cell levels, a marker used to indicate immunocompetence in infected individuals. Upon analysis they found two distinct phyla present in abundance – Firmicutes and Proteobacteria – but it was discovered that α -Proteobacteria predominated independent of host immune status, providing evidence for its role as an infectious and communicable agent within the brain microenvironment. Ultimately, this study seeks to gain further knowledge about this unique microbiome distribution among those suffering from advanced stages of AIDS as well as identify potential anti-microbial targets which may play a key role in providing successful therapeutic interventions moving forward..",1

Isolation and characterization of microparticles in sputum from cystic fibrosis patients,"BACKGROUND: Microparticles (MPs) are membrane vesicles released during cell activation and apoptosis. MPs have different biological effects depending on the cell from they originate. Cystic fibrosis (CF) lung disease is characterized by massive neutrophil granulocyte influx in the airways, their activation and eventually apoptosis. We investigated on the presence and phenotype of MPs in the sputum, a rich non-invasive source of inflammation biomarkers, of acute and stable CF adult patients. METHODS: Spontaneous sputum, obtained from 21 CF patients (10 acute and 11 stable) and 7 patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia (PCD), was liquefied with Sputasol. MPs were counted, visualized by electron microscopy, and identified in the supernatants of treated sputum by cytofluorimetry and immunolabelling for leukocyte (CD11a), granulocyte (CD66b), and monocyte-macrophage (CD11b) antigens. RESULTS: Electron microscopy revealed that sputum MPs were in the 100-500 nm range and did not contain bacteria, confirming microbiological tests. CF sputa contained higher number of MPs in comparison with PCD sputa. Levels of CD11a(+)-and CD66b(+)-, but not CD11b(+)-MPs were significantly higher in CF than in PCD, without differences between acute and stable patients. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, MPs are detectable in sputa obtained from CF patients and are predominantly of granulocyte origin. This novel isolation method for MPs from sputum opens a new opportunity for the study of lung pathology in CF.",0
"Differential Effects of IL-12 on Tregs and Non-Treg T Cells: Roles of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-2R","

This study seeks to investigate the differential effects of interleukin-12 (IL-12) on regulatory T cells (Tregs) and non-Treg T cells, focusing particularly on the roles of interferon gamma (IFNγ), interleukin 2 (IL-2), and IL-2R. Emerging evidence suggests that these three molecules are key mediators in controlling immune responses through their actions on CD4+ effector T cell subsets; however, it remains unknown how these cytokines regulate inflammatory responses for different types of activated T cells, such as regulatory versus non‑Tregs. Utilizing in vitro cultures and mouse models with impaired IFNγ, IL‑2 and/or IL‑2 receptors provides insight into this important yet understudied area related to immunoregulation. The results gathered from our investigations can ultimately contribute towards a greater understand between biological processes on a mechanistic level while informing therapeutic considerations aiming at modulating particular aspects of inflammation or chemokine production through inhibition, enhancement or neutralization strategies.",1
Serodiagnosis of Echinococcus spp. Infection: Explorative Selection of Diagnostic Antigens by Peptide Microarray,"BACKGROUND: Production of native antigens for serodiagnosis of helminthic infections is laborious and hampered by batch-to-batch variation. For serodiagnosis of echinococcosis, especially cystic disease, most screening tests rely on crude or purified Echinococcus granulosus hydatid cyst fluid. To resolve limitations associated with native antigens in serological tests, the use of standardized and highly pure antigens produced by chemical synthesis offers considerable advantages, provided appropriate diagnostic sensitivity and specificity is achieved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Making use of the growing collection of genomic and proteomic data, we applied a set of bioinformatic selection criteria to a collection of protein sequences including conceptually translated nucleotide sequence data of two related tapeworms, Echinococcus multilocularis and Echinococcus granulosus. Our approach targeted alpha-helical coiled-coils and intrinsically unstructured regions of parasite proteins potentially exposed to the host immune system. From 6 proteins of E. multilocularis and 5 proteins of E. granulosus, 45 peptides between 24 and 30 amino acids in length were designed. These peptides were chemically synthesized, spotted on microarrays and screened for reactivity with sera from infected humans. Peptides reacting above the cut-off were validated in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Peptides identified failed to differentiate between E. multilocularis and E. granulosus infection. The peptide performing best reached 57% sensitivity and 94% specificity. This candidate derived from Echinococcus multilocularis antigen B8/1 and showed strong reactivity to sera from patients infected either with E. multilocularis or E. granulosus. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides proof of principle for the discovery of diagnostically relevant peptides by bioinformatic selection complemented with screening on a high-throughput microarray platform. Our data showed that a single peptide cannot provide sufficient diagnostic sensitivity whereas pooling several peptide antigens improved sensitivity; thus combinations of several peptides may lead the way to new diagnostic tests that replace, or at least complement conventional immunodiagnosis of echinococcosis. Our strategy could prove useful for diagnostic developments in other pathogens.",0

Antagonistic Pleiotropy and Fitness Trade-Offs Reveal Specialist and Generalist Traits in Strains of Canine Distemper Virus,"

This paper presents a novel predictive model that examines two types of intra- and inter-strain interactions amongst different strains of Canine Distemper Virus (CDV). Using antagonistic pleiotropy and fitness trade-off theory, we assess how specialist or generalist phenotypic traits might be determined through interactions between different CDV genotypes. By using transmission electron micrographs to visualize the changes in visible characteristics caused by mutations which occur during strain change, we are able to connect these morphologic alterations with underlying genetic differences in the virus. This provides additional insight into which strains display traits that make them both competitively advantageous and capable of upending existing adaptational pressure. We leverage our predictive model for predicting intrastrain fitness cost–benefit ratios as well as their dynamic changes over time and space. Our results indicate that CDV populations possess an array of specialist versus generalist traits which can respond rapidly when environ­mental stresses become exaggerated or abate due to variable selection pressures; this supports the notion that specialized characteristics generally present lower average resistance score than more generalized lines under similar environmental influences. We predict from our results could help assume more accurate tools for epidemiological forecasting, host adaptation succession empirical formulae and system optimization efforts. Ultimately it should improve preventive means against illness outbreaks amongst canine varieties host models as well as provide insights into evolution itself by highlighting mechanisms at play enabling CDVs regulatory consistency at all levels despite periodic mutation spikes cause by incorporation episodes related to immune avoidance strategies decided upon after error prone attempts for circulating hostile milieu",1
Polyomaviruses KI and WU in Immunocompromised Patients with Respiratory Disease,"Polyomaviruses KI (KIPyV) and WU (WUPyV) were recently identified, mainly in respiratory specimens from children. Among 200 patients with respiratory disorders admitted to Saint Louis Hospital, Paris, France, KIPyV was detected in 8% and WUPyV in 1%.

Gene expression in epithelial cells in response to pneumovirus infection,"Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) are viruses of the family Paramyxoviridae, subfamily pneumovirus, which cause clinically important respiratory infections in humans and rodents, respectively. The respiratory epithelial target cells respond to viral infection with specific alterations in gene expression, including production of chemoattractant cytokines, adhesion molecules, elements that are related to the apoptosis response, and others that remain incompletely understood. Here we review our current understanding of these mucosal responses and discuss several genomic approaches, including differential display reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and gene array strategies, that will permit us to unravel the nature of these responses in a more complete and systematic manner.",0
The VNTR Polymorphism of the DC-SIGNR Gene and Susceptibility to HIV-1 Infection: A Meta-Analysis,"

This meta-analysis study investigates the association between the VNTR polymorphism of the DC-SIGNR gene and susceptibility to HIV-1 infection among different populations. Variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphisms have been associated with various diseases, but its role in susceptibility to HIV-1 is not clear. In this paper, epidemiological data from studies investigating the link between VNTR variations in DC-SIGNR gene and HIV-1 infection were compiled through a systematic review of articles published from 2000 to 2020 and included a total population sample size of 1547 subjects distributed across 8 countries on 4 continents. The results demonstrate that our findings suggest an absence correlation between DC-SIGNR genotype and HIV-1 risk, suggesting that genetic variation at this locus may not be strongly involved in determining individual’s genetic background for the disease onset when it is exposed to other factors. Further investigation into this region has potential implications for understanding human predisposition for viral infections such as HIV-1 transmission which could result in improved diagnosis methods or prospective treatment approaches .",1
Suppression of Adenosine-Activated Chloride Transport by Ethanol in Airway Epithelia,"

This study examines the effect of ethanol on adenosine-activated chloride transport in airway epithelia. We aim to determine whether inhibition of airway epithelial chloride secretion by ethanol occurs via a direct or indirect mechanism. This research builds upon prior studies that have identified adenosine as a potent secretagogue for ion effluxes in several cell types, including those found in the respiratory system. To this end, we utilized an animal model with intrapulmonary administration of both adenosine and ethanol and then tested tracheal tissues to compare outcomes between control cultures and the treatment group. Our findings suggest that while adenosine significantly enhances ionic transepithelial conductance, this response is suppressed by co-administration of ethanol, which points towards modulation at the molecular level being influenced by alcohol intake. The overall implications of these results provide insight into how dietary habits may be associated with increased prevalence rates for certain diseases involving lung pathology.",1
An update on swine-origin influenza virus A/H1N1: a review,"

Furthermore, emerged prophylactic strategies are suggested for inference based upon the included studies analysis results compiled from academic journal databases such as PubMed Central and Web Of Science .In conclusion latest research findings enable vital epidemic preparedness measures across intercontinental dimensions thus revealing rare aspects pertaining completeness factor of ancient science.",1
Virus Identification in Unknown Tropical Febrile Illness Cases Using Deep Sequencing,"

Viral infections are an important cause of febrile illnesses in tropical countries where rapid, accurate diagnosis is a challenge. To provide insight into the role of viral pathogens in such illnesses and their epidemiology, we describe a novel method for virus identification by utilizing next-generation deep sequencing technology (DST) to provide comprehensive coverage of various virus families. We present our results from the application of this approach on two matched sets of clinical samples derived from fecal specimens obtained from 12 people presenting with unknown tropical febrile illness between May 2012 and November 2013. Our study shows that DST can be used to rapidly characterize viruses associated with these illnesses and provides data on their molecular characteristics, thus enhancing pathogen surveillance abilities while demonstrating a major step towards improving our understanding of disease etiology in endemic populations.",1
Evaluation of Four Different Systems for Extraction of RNA from Stool Suspensions Using MS-2 Coliphage as an Exogenous Control for RT-PCR Inhibition,"

This study evaluates four different systems for extraction of RNA from stool suspensions, using MS-2 coliphage as an exogenous control for RT-PCR inhibition. To identify a reliable method for analyzing stool samples, the efficiency and sensitivity of each system were evaluated following standard protocols. The four methods examined were guanidine isothyocyante denaturation followed by Phenol/Chloroform/Isoamyl alcohol (GITC) extraction; magnetic bead based homogenization (MBH); TRIzol; and silica matrix filtration (SMF). Results showed that SMF was determined to be the most efficient approach with the highest levels of total extracted nucleic acids, while TBH had the lowest overall results among tested procedures. Furthermore, GITC enabled precise detection at low C T values and higher relative band intensity compared to other protocols across multiple molar concentrations. Overall, this experiment demonstrated that SMF provided effective performance over TBH in terms of yield concentration as well as C T cycle range while still being capable of detecting target genetic material with eqaul precision throughout the test series when compared against GITC or TRIzol treatment conditions. In conclusion, it can be said that out of these four approaches assessed herein, SMF provided superior results for extracting high quality genetic information from faecal matrices in comparison to other tested systems when monitored via exogenous control probe analysis employing RT-PCR technology.",1
Pandemic A/H1N1v influenza 2009 in hospitalized children: a multicenter Belgian survey,"

This study evaluates the occurrence and characteristics of pediatric cases admitted to five Belgian hospital centers because of pandemic A/H1N1v influenza 2009. Over a three-month period from November 2009 to January 2010, 261 hospitalized children were included and their clinical data was recorded. The repercussions this novel virus had on the pediatric population during a viral epidemic that initially spread with blistering speed generated significant public health concern worldwide and in Belgium amongst clinicians as well as among policy makers. This survey sheds light upon Pandemic A/H1N1v Influenza 2009's impact on hospitalized pediatric patients at Belgian hospitals in an effort to better understand which pathogenic viruses triggered it, what associated symptoms can be expected, which prophylactic treatments are optimal or whether any additional measures should be taken when attending sick children presenting with potential A/H1N1v labels.

Post-Transcriptional Control of Type I Interferon Induction by Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus in Its Natural Host Cells,"

This article aims to demonstrate the hitherto unrecognised role of post-transcriptional control in modulating the induction of Type I interferon (IFN) by Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) in its natural host cells. We sought to ascertain if infection with PRRSV increased IFN levels beyond those associated with conventional transcriptional regulation, and further determine the underlying molecular mediators responsible for this process. Furthermore, our findings provide new insights into previously uncovered mechanisms governing antiviral response following PRRS exposure. Our study presents evidence that suggest a distinct contribution of post-transcriptional pathways in driving IFN receptor expression upon recognition of viral threat from PRRSV, which significantly contributes towards determining an effective overall immune defence outcome against virus propagation.",1

Through rigorous systematic review and meta-analysis of data extracted from various sources, this study attempts to reveal whether, and how much shenfu injection can reduce the mortality rate associated with heart failure. To address this research question, a comprehensive search for relevant clinical trials up to June 2020 was conducted using international databases such as Pubmed, Medline and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), etc. The qualitative synthesis performed through narrative review facilitated by thematic analysis then allowed us to summarise evidence obtained from selected studies in order to reach conclusions on the outcomes presented here.",1
DNA Vaccines against Protozoan Parasites: Advances and Challenges,"Over the past 15 years, DNA vaccines have gone from a scientific curiosity to one of the most dynamic research field and may offer new alternatives for the control of parasitic diseases such as leishmaniasis and Chagas disease. We review here some of the advances and challenges for the development of DNA vaccines against these diseases. Many studies have validated the concept of using DNA vaccines for both protection and therapy against these protozoan parasites in a variety of mouse models. The challenge now is to translate what has been achieved in these models into veterinary or human vaccines of comparable efficacy. Also, genome-mining and new antigen discovery strategies may provide new tools for a more rational search of novel vaccine candidates.",0
National intensive care unit bed capacity and ICU patient characteristics in a low income country,"

The title of this article is ‘National intensive care unit bed capacity and ICU patient characteristics in a low income country’. Patients requiring intensive care are increasingly seen throughout the world, especially at times when pandemics or other health crises emerge. Low-income countries pose an additional challenge due to limited resources available for financing healthcare, as well as inadequate staffing and critical care infrastructure. This study aims to describe the national intensive care unit bed capacity and associated ICU patient characteristics in a low-income country. Through retrospective collection of data from 172 publicly funded hospitals across the region during 2016-2018, the authors have compared patient demographics, ICU admission rates according to location (rural vs urban), length of stay in hospital for all patients diagnosed with COVID-19, mortality rates due to acute respiratory failure caused by coronavirus infection, as well as quantifying pressures on regionalized systems related to lack of availability of beds or personnel shortages within them. The results presented herein provide new insights into how poor access can affect morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases such Alzheimer’s or Parkinson's disease or chronic illnesses like diabetes affecting diverse populations across political boundaries globally.",1
PaCO(2 )and alveolar dead space are more relevant than PaO(2)/FiO(2 )ratio in monitoring the respiratory response to prone position in ARDS patients: a physiological study,"

This article aims to investigate the impact of prone positioning on respiratory parameter monitoring in patients suffering from acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Specifically, we examine whether PaCO2 and alveolar dead space can better assess the response to prone position than traditional monitorings such as PaO2/FiO2 ratio. By using a physiological studies approach, this paper provides an insight into an effective management strategy for ARDS patients. 

In recent years, clinical guidelines have emphasized that proning holds promising therapeutic outcomes for severe ARDS cases. However, due to its complexity and high risk of airway obstruction caused by anatomical changes during body posture alterations, appropriate patient selection is essential for successful implementation of treatment plans with proning tactics. Moreover, monitoring systems are needed that reflect the severity and impact of prone positioning on respiration effectiveness without relying solely on traditional rating scales or simple mathematical equations like PaO2/ FiO2 ratios. 

To further explore these topics more deeply, we conducted prospective interventional trials in which 30 sufferers aged 18-55 with moderate severity (Pa02/FIO2 <200 mmHg) were randomly assigned to either standard supine care or 30 hours prorated treatments followed by 10 hours supine recovery periods during which no other interventions took place apart from standard oxygen administration. The lung variable data was collected over 5 successive days including total minute ventilation levels were measured alongside arterial blood gases (ABG), partial pressures of CO₂(PaCO₂), inflection point analysis and pressure volume curves estimation test results. The major objective was evaluating pulmonary function based upon intrinsic parameters associated with gas exchange through focused venous admixtures sampling at specific intervals throughout each cycle period equally separated between prone sessions versus controlled breathing exercises performed in standing positions then lying down conditions respectively before transitions into further cycle phases post transition day five completion deadlines after roller coaster routine repetitions terminated across control groups allocated according to race abd gender demographics statistical distribution estimates while conformed cohort support documents indicated variations associative respective ranging dependent functional impairment diagnoses categories indicative listing low moral hazard density level contractual agreements mandated terms conditions pertaining non compensated associated consented declared patient agreement applicant litigant involved filed pending applications negotiations institution stipulation abide meted standardized protocols existing benchmark checkpts corresponding valid validate criteria standards paperwork procedures set forth herein outlined specifically related detailed information provided summation dispositive lack dispute resolution mechanism enforceable legislatively state chosen jurisdictional laws jurisdiction consideration expressly compliance consent stated hereinabove topics matters disputes arbitrate subject matter discourse contract provisions warranty disclaimer agreement void null considered superseded held contained document legal considerations aside binding effective non obvioust implied hereunto undersigned witness signatories references full term duration promulgation enforcement implamentations attestation conclusion acquiescence any action manifest rely explicitly concludes caption allowing transfer authorization title deeding delivery statement verbal cognizance release exhonerate pertinent liabilities actions actuation derive enforce executary obtain statutary governed executions promissory note acceptances requests evidentiary memorializations committments attachments auxillary cumulative consecutively sequentiall rendered decisions parties complicity exhibits issued timelines date outbound durations preamble distillation sum report aforementinoned captured entiriety discretely fulfill entire ambit investigation examinant endpoints outset initialization project projected premise simulations projecgted conclusions demostrably expressed nor expressed directly liscence requirements compliances accepted applied metrics measureables targets deliverables deemed sufficient conclusive within allowable given inevitable deviations mean gravities variances aggregate assessed parllaele processes treatises formulae discernible predetermined assignments enumerated contingencies accordingly capped mediuim ranges mid determinants oscillations exclusively extreme extended extremities addressed composite ratios logical probabilities index correlated rate elasticity relavant derived itemized instruction manual outlining specifc charactersitics Permisses Criteria Rating Scale Evaulators concurrently leading clearly Delinears final Navigable alternative goals paths plotted routes reevaluate pathing marking target path Disengage settings",1
Secretory phospholipase A2 pathway in various types of lung injury in neonates and infants: a multicentre translational study,"

This multicentre translational study focuses on the secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) pathway in various types of lung injury affecting neonates and infants. An important component of pulmonary surfactant, sPLA2 is involved in inflammation responses as well as parenchymal destruction; therefore its role in pediatric respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia warrants investigation. In this retrospective analysis, data from multiple centers were collected to identify a link between sPLA2 expression levels and severity of acute lung injury or preterm RDS. The “omics” approach allowed for a comprehensive metabolomic profiling of mediators associated with the pathophysiology of acute lungs injuries. Results demonstrate significant differences in serum level concentrations across all studied patient populations based on gestational age, birth weight, oxygen supplementation treatment received prior to enrollment into study group cohorts. To further elucidate any potential associations between observed imbalances in biomarkers regulating inflammatory response mechanisms, post-study histology was ascertained to confirm findings from initial analyses using advanced imaging modalities such as MRI and CT scans from participants enrolled at each observational site . Ultimately this research sheds light on critical aspects related to prenatal nutrition status that can lead to extremely premature newborns experiencing severe adults forms of health complications requiring intensive care support by providing an insight into altered metabolic regulation contributing towards unresolved pulmonary defects present during foetal stages often undiagnosed until immediately after delivery - eventually leading onto life long irreversible damage experienced due overaggressive interventions meant course correct fatal consequences born out by parental negligence towards informed preventative decisions surrounding maternal wellbeing programmes inline accepted medical practice standards adopted where possible en masse through subsidised government incentives thereby ultimately closing knowledge gaps still sadly prevailing even now around world today short/long term out reaching humanitarian objectives evidenced herein should prove sufficient groundwork actionable implementation strategies wider global community educational projects way uncovering better solutions preventive healthcare generally paving bright new futures countless generations come just begin laying foundation do it aptly soon prepare anybody affected misfortune prematurely born sons daughters necessitating opening family dialogues frank honest open natures drive awareness making sure fully understand pros cons treatments available depending circumstances clearly highlighting enormously brave valuable contribution both personally professionally science without risking losses suffered faced same circumstances thankful invaluable benevolent help medicine could ever show us quite sublime yet kindness obviously does end there life continuing serve purpose within greater whole benefit everyone experience grows & healing finally begins …",1
Interstitial lung diseases in children,"Interstitial lung disease (ILD) in infants and children comprises a large spectrum of rare respiratory disorders that are mostly chronic and associated with high morbidity and mortality. These disorders are characterized by inflammatory and fibrotic changes that affect alveolar walls. Typical features of ILD include dyspnea, diffuse infiltrates on chest radiographs, and abnormal pulmonary function tests with restrictive ventilatory defect and/or impaired gas exchange. Many pathological situations can impair gas exchange and, therefore, may contribute to progressive lung damage and ILD. Consequently, diagnosis approach needs to be structured with a clinical evaluation requiring a careful history paying attention to exposures and systemic diseases. Several classifications for ILD have been proposed but none is entirely satisfactory especially in children. The present article reviews current concepts of pathophysiological mechanisms, etiology and diagnostic approaches, as well as therapeutic strategies. The following diagnostic grouping is used to discuss the various causes of pediatric ILD: 1) exposure-related ILD; 2) systemic disease-associated ILD; 3) alveolar structure disorder-associated ILD; and 4) ILD specific to infancy. Therapeutic options include mainly anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, and/or anti-fibrotic drugs. The outcome is highly variable with a mortality rate around 15%. An overall favorable response to corticosteroid therapy is observed in around 50% of cases, often associated with sequelae such as limited exercise tolerance or the need for long-term oxygen therapy.",0
Overlapping signals for translational regulation and packaging of influenza A virus segment 2,"

This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the biological events related to the regulation and packaging of Influenza A virus segment 2. By focusing on concurrent changes in post-transcriptional mechanisms, namely regulated splicing, transcription termination and ribosomal frameshifting, this comparative study has identified common overlapping signals that enable synergistic control and integration of these processes through alternative expression strategies at different stages throughout the course of infection. Results indicate that coordinated interactions between distinct molecular pathways offer a level of complexity essential for translational regulation during influenza virus replication. The implications associated with granular control over gene expression are discussed accordingly with implications for genome stability in tissue culture systems as well as medically relevant viral strains.",1
On pandemics and the duty to care: whose duty? who cares?,"BACKGROUND: As a number of commentators have noted, SARS exposed the vulnerabilities of our health care systems and governance structures. Health care professionals (HCPs) and hospital systems that bore the brunt of the SARS outbreak continue to struggle with the aftermath of the crisis. Indeed, HCPs – both in clinical care and in public health – were severely tested by SARS. Unprecedented demands were placed on their skills and expertise, and their personal commitment to their profession was severely tried. Many were exposed to serious risk of morbidity and mortality, as evidenced by the World Health Organization figures showing that approximately 30% of reported cases were among HCPs, some of whom died from the infection. Despite this challenge, professional codes of ethics are silent on the issue of duty to care during communicable disease outbreaks, thus providing no guidance on what is expected of HCPs or how they ought to approach their duty to care in the face of risk. DISCUSSION: In the aftermath of SARS and with the spectre of a pandemic avian influenza, it is imperative that we (re)consider the obligations of HCPs for patients with severe infectious diseases, particularly diseases that pose risks to those providing care. It is of pressing importance that organizations representing HCPs give clear indication of what standard of care is expected of their members in the event of a pandemic. In this paper, we address the issue of special obligations of HCPs during an infectious disease outbreak. We argue that there is a pressing need to clarify the rights and responsibilities of HCPs in the current context of pandemic flu preparedness, and that these rights and responsibilities ought to be codified in professional codes of ethics. Finally, we present a brief historical accounting of the treatment of the duty to care in professional health care codes of ethics. SUMMARY: An honest and critical examination of the role of HCPs during communicable disease outbreaks is needed in order to provide guidelines regarding professional rights and responsibilities, as well as ethical duties and obligations. With this paper, we hope to open the social dialogue and advance the public debate on this increasingly urgent issue.",0
Globalization and Health,"This debut editorial of Globalization and Health introduces the journal, briefly delineating its goals and objectives and outlines its scope of subject matter. 'Open Access' publishing is expected to become an increasingly important format for peer reviewed academic journals and that Globalization and Health is 'Open Access' is appropriate. The rationale behind starting a journal dedicated to globalization and health is three fold: Firstly: Globalization is reshaping the social geography within which we might strive to create health or prevent disease. The determinants of health – be they a SARS virus or a predilection for fatty foods – have joined us in our global mobility. Driven by economic liberalization and changing technologies, the phenomenon of 'access' is likely to dominate to an increasing extent the unfolding experience of human disease and wellbeing. Secondly: Understanding globalization as a subject matter itself needs certain benchmarks and barometers of its successes and failings. Health is one such barometer. It is a marker of social infrastructure and social welfare and as such can be used to either sound an alarm or give a victory cheer as our interconnectedness hurts and heals the populations we serve. And lastly: In as much as globalization can have an effect on health, it is also true that health and disease has an effect on globalization as exemplified by the existence of quarantine laws and the devastating economic effects of the AIDS pandemic. A balanced view would propose that the effects of globalization on health (and health systems) are neither universally good nor bad, but rather context specific. If the dialogue pertaining to globalization is to be directed or biased in any direction, then it must be this: that we consider the poor first.",0
Identification of pneumonia and influenza deaths using the death certificate pipeline,"

This study examines the use of death certificates as a reliable source for assessing mortality rates from pneumonia and influenza (P&I). Despite their widespread availability, there is insufficient understanding of the accuracy and completeness of reporting P&I deaths on death certificates. The objectives are to explore how P&I deaths are identified in vital statistics data within Washington State, by evaluating discrepancies between two commonly used methods of identifying these causes-of-death, namely International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and text descriptions within cause-of-death fields. To achieve these aims, descriptive analyses were conducted to compare the number of reported deaths attributed to ICD specified P&I against those recorded with diagnosis text conforming to established criteria. 
The findings indicate that ICD codes reliably capture only a small portion compared to manual coding which tapped into additional available information regarding individual cases in order to classify them as definitive or probable P&l related mortalities using pattern recognition techniques. It was also noted that inconsistent tagging practices may influence results when attempting sophisticated analytical approaches such as temporal monitoring trends at local level.. In light of its implications for public health approaches targeting this particular cause group in upcoming epidemiological scenarios, this research concludes with key insights relevant for stakeholders across policy making domains particularly related surveillance capabilities along with recommendations drawn from observed disparities arising from human factors associated medical record keeping .",1
Mannose-binding lectin deficiency and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,"

This paper examines the potential association between mannose-binding lectin deficiency and acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Mannose-binding lectin is a circulating protein that mediates innate immunity. Recent literature suggests an impaired capability for recognition of microbial stimuli in patients with COPD, which has led to speculation that Mannose-binding lectin may contribute to the pathophysiology of acute exacerbations of COPD. The objective of this work was to evaluate the relationship between Mannose-binding lectin levels and risk for COPD exacerbation among individuals with moderate or severe forms of the condition. A prospective study encompassing 190 outpatients from two hospitals identified through chart review was conducted wherein participants completed clinical assessments as well as lab testing at baseline and every one month interval for up to 12 months. Primary outcome analysis demonstrated that fewer participants who were diagnosed with both COPD and had deficient levels of Mannose-binding lectin experienced acute cohort exacerbations than those without similarly diminished MBL levels.

"IL-1β, IL-6, and RANTES as Biomarkers of Chikungunya Severity","BACKGROUND: Little is known about the immunopathogenesis of Chikungunya virus. Circulating levels of immune mediators and growth factors were analyzed from patients infected during the first Singaporean Chikungunya fever outbreak in early 2008 to establish biomarkers associated with infection and/or disease severity. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Adult patients with laboratory-confirmed Chikungunya fever infection, who were referred to the Communicable Disease Centre/Tan Tock Seng Hospital during the period from January to February 2008, were included in this retrospective study. Plasma fractions were analyzed using a multiplex-microbead immunoassay. Among the patients, the most common clinical features were fever (100%), arthralgia (90%), rash (50%) and conjunctivitis (40%). Profiles of 30 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors were able to discriminate the clinical forms of Chikungunya from healthy controls, with patients classified as non-severe and severe disease. Levels of 8 plasma cytokines and 4 growth factors were significantly elevated. Statistical analysis showed that an increase in IL-1β, IL-6 and a decrease in RANTES were associated with disease severity. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive report on the production of cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors during acute Chikungunya virus infection. Using these biomarkers, we were able to distinguish between mild disease and more severe forms of Chikungunya fever, thus enabling the identification of patients with poor prognosis and monitoring of the disease.",0
"La Crosse virus infectivity, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in mice and monkeys","BACKGROUND: La Crosse virus (LACV), family Bunyaviridae, was first identified as a human pathogen in 1960 after its isolation from a 4 year-old girl with fatal encephalitis in La Crosse, Wisconsin. LACV is a major cause of pediatric encephalitis in North America and infects up to 300,000 persons each year of which 70–130 result in severe disease of the central nervous system (CNS). As an initial step in the establishment of useful animal models to support vaccine development, we examined LACV infectivity, pathogenesis, and immunogenicity in both weanling mice and rhesus monkeys. RESULTS: Following intraperitoneal inoculation of mice, LACV replicated in various organs before reaching the CNS where it replicates to high titer causing death from neurological disease. The peripheral site where LACV replicates to highest titer is the nasal turbinates, and, presumably, LACV can enter the CNS via the olfactory neurons from nasal olfactory epithelium. The mouse infectious dose(50 )and lethal dose(50 )was similar for LACV administered either intranasally or intraperitoneally. LACV was highly infectious for rhesus monkeys and infected 100% of the animals at 10 PFU. However, the infection was asymptomatic, and the monkeys developed a strong neutralizing antibody response. CONCLUSION: In mice, LACV likely gains access to the CNS via the blood stream or via olfactory neurons. The ability to efficiently infect mice intranasally raises the possibility that LACV might use this route to infect its natural hosts. Rhesus monkeys are susceptible to LACV infection and develop strong neutralizing antibody responses after inoculation with as little as 10 PFU. Mice and rhesus monkeys are useful animal models for LACV vaccine immunologic testing although the rhesus monkey model is not optimal.",0
Correcting errors in synthetic DNA through consensus shuffling,"Although efficient methods exist to assemble synthetic oligonucleotides into genes and genomes, these suffer from the presence of 1–3 random errors/kb of DNA. Here, we introduce a new method termed consensus shuffling and demonstrate its use to significantly reduce random errors in synthetic DNA. In this method, errors are revealed as mismatches by re-hybridization of the population. The DNA is fragmented, and mismatched fragments are removed upon binding to an immobilized mismatch binding protein (MutS). PCR assembly of the remaining fragments yields a new population of full-length sequences enriched for the consensus sequence of the input population. We show that two iterations of consensus shuffling improved a population of synthetic green fluorescent protein (GFPuv) clones from ∼60 to >90% fluorescent, and decreased errors 3.5- to 4.3-fold to final values of ∼1 error per 3500 bp. In addition, two iterations of consensus shuffling corrected a population of GFPuv clones where all members were non-functional, to a population where 82% of clones were fluorescent. Consensus shuffling should facilitate the rapid and accurate synthesis of long DNA sequences.",0
"Acute care utilization due to hospitalizations for pediatric lower respiratory tract infections in British Columbia, Canada","

This paper evaluates the utilization of acute care services due to hospitalizations for pediatric lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in British Columbia, Canada. Lower respiratory tract infections are a major cause of both morbidity and mortality among children worldwide and remain an important source of strain on the Canadian health care system. This study was conducted through an analysis of population-based administrative healthcare data in order to assess trends associated with LTRI hospitalization between 2009-2018. The primary objective is to better understand overall acute care utilization for pediatrics suffering from LRTIs, particularly immediate aftercare needs following discharge from the hospital setting. By providing key insight into this area, policy makers will be able to set relevant clinical guidelines or modify existing ones based upon observed patterns in order increase positive outcomes with LTRIs back in line with global standards or further enhance them altogether.",1
Rfam: updates to the RNA families database,"Rfam is a collection of RNA sequence families, represented by multiple sequence alignments and covariance models (CMs). The primary aim of Rfam is to annotate new members of known RNA families on nucleotide sequences, particularly complete genomes, using sensitive BLAST filters in combination with CMs. A minority of families with a very broad taxonomic range (e.g. tRNA and rRNA) provide the majority of the sequence annotations, whilst the majority of Rfam families (e.g. snoRNAs and miRNAs) have a limited taxonomic range and provide a limited number of annotations. Recent improvements to the website, methodologies and data used by Rfam are discussed. Rfam is freely available on the Web at http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/and http://rfam.janelia.org/.",0

"Pip6-PMO, A New Generation of Peptide-oligonucleotide Conjugates With Improved Cardiac Exon Skipping Activity for DMD Treatment","

This article highlights the development and characterization of a new family of Peptide-oligonucleotide (Pip6-PMO) conjugates with improved cardiac exon skipping activity and applications in Duchene Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) treatment. The peptides were generated using six amino acids, selected based on efficacy reports from prior studies. Employing 1H NMR spectroscopy and electrophoresis tests we found that Pip6-PMOs possess improved physical properties such as increased stability at physiologic pH, reduced tyrosine oxidation levels, lower cytotoxicity and superior target penetration across cells compared to previously known variations. Additionally, when administered intravenously in mice models higher cardiac bioactivity was evident providing potential for clinical translation. This work demonstrates an effective approach to generating more stable forms of therapeutic oligonucleotides delivering significantly enhanced cardioprotection against DMD progression promising greater efficiency in treatment approaches for this disorder.",1
On computational approaches for size-and-shape distributions from sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation,"Sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation has become a very popular technique to study size distributions and interactions of macromolecules. Recently, a method termed two-dimensional spectrum analysis (2DSA) for the determination of size-and-shape distributions was described by Demeler and colleagues (Eur Biophys J 2009). It is based on novel ideas conceived for fitting the integral equations of the size-and-shape distribution to experimental data, illustrated with an example but provided without proof of the principle of the algorithm. In the present work, we examine the 2DSA algorithm by comparison with the mathematical reference frame and simple well-known numerical concepts for solving Fredholm integral equations, and test the key assumptions underlying the 2DSA method in an example application. While the 2DSA appears computationally excessively wasteful, key elements also appear to be in conflict with mathematical results. This raises doubts about the correctness of the results from 2DSA analysis.",0
Peptide-Mediated Cellular Delivery of Oligonucleotide-Based Therapeutics In Vitro: Quantitative Evaluation of Overall Efficacy Employing Easy to Handle Reporter Systems,"Cellular uptake of therapeutic oligonucleotides and subsequent intracellular trafficking to their target sites represents the major technical hurdle for the biological effectiveness of these potential drugs. Accordingly, laboratories worldwide focus on the development of suitable delivery systems. Among the different available non-viral systems like cationic polymers, cationic liposomes and polymeric nanoparticles, cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) represent an attractive concept to bypass the problem of poor membrane permeability of these charged macromolecules. While uptake per se in most cases does not represent the main obstacle of nucleic acid delivery in vitro, it becomes increasingly apparent that intracellular trafficking is the bottleneck. As a consequence, in order to optimize a given delivery system, a side-by-side analysis of nucleic acid cargo internalized and the corresponding biological effect is required to determine the overall efficacy. In this review, we will concentrate on peptide-mediated delivery of siRNAs and steric block oligonucleotides and discuss different methods for quantitative assessment of the amount of cargo taken up and how to correlate those numbers with biological effects by applying easy to handle reporter systems. To illustrate current limitations of non-viral nucleic acid delivery systems, we present own data as an example and discuss options of how to enhance trafficking of molecules entrapped in cellular compartments.",0
Situational Awareness and Health Protective Responses to Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) in Hong Kong: A Cross-Sectional Study,"BACKGROUND: Whether information sources influence health protective behaviours during influenza pandemics or other emerging infectious disease epidemics is uncertain. METHODOLOGY: Data from cross-sectional telephone interviews of 1,001 Hong Kong adults in June, 2009 were tested against theory and data-derived hypothesized associations between trust in (formal/informal) information, understanding, self-efficacy, perceived susceptibility and worry, and hand hygiene and social distancing using Structural Equation Modelling with multigroup comparisons. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Trust in formal (government/media) information about influenza was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause (β = 0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy (β = 0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene (β = 0.19 and β = 0.23, respectively). Trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 susceptibility (β = −0.21), which was negatively associated with perceived self-efficacy (β = −0.42) but positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.44). Trust in informal information was positively associated with influenza worry (β = 0.16) which was in turn associated with greater social distancing (β = 0.36). Multigroup comparisons showed gender differences regarding paths from trust in formal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, trust in informal information to understanding of A/H1N1 cause, and understanding of A/H1N1 cause to perceived self-efficacy. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Trust in government/media information was more strongly associated with greater self-efficacy and handwashing, whereas trust in informal information was strongly associated with perceived health threat and avoidance behaviour. Risk communication should consider the effect of gender differences.",0
"Replication, Neurotropism, and Pathogenicity of Avian Paramyxovirus Serotypes 1–9 in Chickens and Ducks","

To determine the replication, neurotropism, and pathogenicity of Avian Paramyxovirus Serotypes 1–9 (APMV-1 to -9), chickens and ducks were sampled from four different farms in Southeast China. In this study serum antibodies, clinical symptoms, histopathological characteristics of internal organs and pathological lesion formation were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction assays at necropsy. The results showed that APMV 4 and 5 were most commonly detected among poultry surveillance tested sera samples (83%) followed by APMV 2 (19%). Histopathology analysis illuminated a variety of organ damage associated with the susceptibility of different serotypes including necrosis and infiltration to neural tissue while demonstrating infection cause abnormal progression of signaling leading to higher immunogenic response levels from multiple organ systems indicating systemic pathology effects observed. These findings suggest that APMVs are highly replicated in infected birds resulting in significant morbidity rates for both chicken and duck populations which has potential implications for those countries dealing with an increased level avian PPMVs emergence within production-based flocks.

On the possible role of robustness in the evolution of infectious diseases,"Robustness describes the capacity for a biological system to remain canalized despite perturbation. Genetic robustness affords maintenance of phenotype despite mutational input, necessarily involving the role of epistasis. Environmental robustness is phenotypic constancy in the face of environmental variation, where epistasis may be uninvolved. Here we discuss genetic and environmental robustness, from the standpoint of infectious disease evolution, and suggest that robustness may be a unifying principle for understanding how different disease agents evolve. We focus especially on viruses with RNA genomes due to their importance in the evolution of emerging diseases and as model systems to test robustness theory. We present new data on adaptive constraints for a model RNA virus challenged to evolve in response to UV radiation. We also draw attention to other infectious disease systems where robustness theory may prove useful for bridging evolutionary biology and biomedicine, especially the evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacteria, immune evasion by influenza, and malaria parasite infections.",0
"Making sense of perceptions of risk of diseases and vaccinations: a qualitative study combining models of health beliefs, decision-making and risk perception","

This qualitative study seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms of individuals’ risk perceptions and decision-making processes when it comes to diseases and vaccinations. Drawing on models of health beliefs, decision-making and risk assessment, this paper will analyse semi-structured interviews with participants from three different countries. The aim is to elucidate how people's personal experiences shape their views on disease risks; identify whether there are cultural differences between the perceived importance of prevention through vaccination versus traditional preventative measures; explore if mental models can inform the understanding of vaccine acceptance or refusal in each country; and determine what role awareness campaigns may play in influencing behaviour. By reflecting deeply on a range of survey responses connected with both national contexts as well as individual participant experiences, this study aims to provide new insights into why certain population segments remain reluctant towards vaccines despite an increasing amount of infectious diseases being caused due medical negligence issues arising out of unchecked usage earlier devices . Finally, these findings will allow for designing interventions that focus on education about proactive preventive healthcare which suits cultures across diverse settings better over reactive modes involving medicinal treatments later.",1
Is Generalized Maternal Optimism or Pessimism During Pregnancy Associated with Unplanned Cesarean Section Deliveries in China?,"This research examines whether maternal optimism/pessimism is associated with unplanned Cesarean section deliveries in China. If so, does the association remain after controlling for clinical factors associated with C-sections? A sample of 227 mostly primiparous women in the third trimester of pregnancy was surveyed in a large tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China. Post-delivery data were collected from medical records. In bivariate analysis, both optimism and pessimism were related to unplanned c-section. However, when optimism and pessimism were entered into a regression model together, optimism was no longer statistically significant. Pessimism remained significant, even when adjusting for clinical factors such as previous abortion, previous miscarriage, pregnancy complications, infant gestational age, infant birthweight, labor duration, birth complications, and self-rated difficulty of the pregnancy. This research suggests that maternal mindset during pregnancy has a role in mode of delivery.

"Can ""presumed consent"" justify the duty to treat infectious diseases? An analysis","BACKGROUND: AIDS, SARS, and the recent epidemics of the avian-flu have all served to remind us the debate over the limits of the moral duty to care. It is important to first consider the question of whether or not the ""duty to treat"" might be subject to contextual constraints. The purpose of this study was to investigate the opinions and beliefs held by both physicians and dentists regarding the occupational risks of infectious diseases, and to analyze the argument that the notion of ""presumed consent"" on the part of professionals may be grounds for supporting the duty to treat. METHODS: For this cross-sectional survey, the study population was selected from among physicians and dentists in Ankara. All of the 373 participants were given a self-administered questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 79.6% of the participants said that they either had some degree of knowledge about the risks when they chose their profession or that they learned of the risks later during their education and training. Of the participants, 5.2% said that they would not have chosen this profession if they had been informed of the risks. It was found that 57% of the participants believed that there is a standard level of risk, and 52% of the participants stated that certain diseases would exceed the level of acceptable risk unless specific protective measures were implemented. CONCLUSION: If we use the presumed consent argument to establish the duty of the HCW to provide care, we are confronted with problems ranging over the difficulty of choosing a profession autonomously, the constant level of uncertainty present in the medical profession, the near-impossibility of being able to evaluate retrospectively whether every individual was informed, and the seemingly inescapable problem that this practice would legitimize, and perhaps even foster, discrimination against patients with certain diseases. Our findings suggest that another problem can be added to the list: one-fifth of the participants in this study either lacked adequate knowledge of the occupational risks when they chose the medical profession or were not sufficiently informed of these risks during their faculty education and training. Furthermore, in terms of the moral duty to provide care, it seems that most HCWs are more concerned about the availability of protective measures than about whether they had been informed of a particular risk beforehand. For all these reasons, the presumed consent argument is not persuasive enough, and cannot be used to justify the duty to provide care. It is therefore more useful to emphasize justifications other than presumed consent when defining the duty of HCWs to provide care, such as the social contract between society and the medical profession and the fact that HCWs have a greater ability to provide medical aid.",0
Antisense-induced ribosomal frameshifting,"Programmed ribosomal frameshifting provides a mechanism to decode information located in two overlapping reading frames by diverting a proportion of translating ribosomes into a second open reading frame (ORF). The result is the production of two proteins: the product of standard translation from ORF1 and an ORF1–ORF2 fusion protein. Such programmed frameshifting is commonly utilized as a gene expression mechanism in viruses that infect eukaryotic cells and in a subset of cellular genes. RNA secondary structures, consisting of pseudoknots or stem–loops, located downstream of the shift site often act as cis-stimulators of frameshifting. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that antisense oligonucleotides can functionally mimic these RNA structures to induce +1 ribosomal frameshifting when annealed downstream of the frameshift site, UCC UGA. Antisense-induced shifting of the ribosome into the +1 reading frame is highly efficient in both rabbit reticulocyte lysate translation reactions and in cultured mammalian cells. The efficiency of antisense-induced frameshifting at this site is responsive to the sequence context 5′ of the shift site and to polyamine levels.",0
Further Characterisation of the Translational Termination-Reinitiation Signal of the Influenza B Virus Segment 7 RNA,"Termination-dependent reinitiation is used to co-ordinately regulate expression of the M1 and BM2 open-reading frames (ORFs) of the dicistronic influenza B segment 7 RNA. The start codon of the BM2 ORF overlaps the stop codon of the M1 ORF in the pentanucleotide UAA UG and ∼10% of ribosomes terminating at the M1 stop codon reinitiate translation at the overlapping AUG. BM2 synthesis requires the presence of, and translation through, 45 nt of RNA immediately upstream of the UAA UG, known as the ‘termination upstream ribosome binding site’ (TURBS). This region may tether ribosomal 40S subunits to the mRNA following termination and a short region of the TURBS, motif 1, with complementarity to helix 26 of 18S rRNA has been implicated in this process. Here, we provide further evidence for a direct interaction between mRNA and rRNA using antisense oligonucleotide targeting and functional analysis in yeast cells. The TURBS also binds initiation factor eIF3 and we show here that this protein stimulates reinitiation from both wild-type and defective TURBS when added exogenously, perhaps by stabilising ribosome-mRNA interactions. Further, we show that the position of the TURBS with respect to the UAA UG overlap is crucial, and that termination too far downstream of the 18S complementary sequence inhibits the process, probably due to reduced 40S tethering. However, in reporter mRNAs where the restart codon alone is moved downstream, termination-reinitiation is inhibited but not abolished, thus the site of reinitiation is somewhat flexible. Reinitiation on distant AUGs is not inhibited in eIF4G-depleted RRL, suggesting that the tethered 40S subunit can move some distance without a requirement for linear scanning.",0
"Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 among Quarantined Close Contacts, Beijing, People’s Republic of China","

This study aims to assess the risk of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (pH1N1) 2009 among quarantined close contacts in Beijing, People’s Republic of China. After an initial laboratory-confirmed case of pH1N1 was diagnosed, surveillance and contact tracing were conducted urgently. Close contacts identified during this process were closely monitored with daily symptom reports and induced into a period of home quarantine to await further examination for possible infection. During the contact follow-up period, we will examine clinical characteristics as well as co-factors associated with secondary infection outcome among quarantinedclose contacts. The results from this study will provide important information on strategies related to early detection and response planning by health authorities concerning pH1N 1 infections throughout People’s Republic of China.",1
Amino Acid Similarity Accounts for T Cell Cross-Reactivity and for “Holes” in the T Cell Repertoire,"BACKGROUND: Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) cross-reactivity is believed to play a pivotal role in generating immune responses but the extent and mechanisms of CTL cross-reactivity remain largely unknown. Several studies suggest that CTL clones can recognize highly diverse peptides, some sharing no obvious sequence identity. The emerging realization in the field is that T cell receptors (TcR) recognize multiple distinct ligands. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: First, we analyzed peptide scans of the HIV epitope SLFNTVATL (SFL9) and found that TCR specificity is position dependent and that biochemically similar amino acid substitutions do not drastically affect recognition. Inspired by this, we developed a general model of TCR peptide recognition using amino acid similarity matrices and found that such a model was able to predict the cross-reactivity of a diverse set of CTL epitopes. With this model, we were able to demonstrate that seemingly distinct T cell epitopes, i.e., ones with low sequence identity, are in fact more biochemically similar than expected. Additionally, an analysis of HIV immunogenicity data with our model showed that CTLs have the tendency to respond mostly to peptides that do not resemble self-antigens. CONCLUSIONS: T cell cross-reactivity can thus, to an extent greater than earlier appreciated, be explained by amino acid similarity. The results presented in this paper will help resolving some of the long-lasting discussions in the field of T cell cross-reactivity.",0
The Evolutionary Dynamics of Stochastic Epidemic Model with Nonlinear Incidence Rate,"

The article 'The Evolutionary Dynamics of Stochastic Epidemic Model with Nonlinear Incidence Rate' investigates the effects of random fluctuations on epidemiological dynamics. A non-linear incidence rate model is proposed and stochastic simulations are performed to examine its impact on transmission and evolution over time. The results indicate that such a model can capture certain features in a realistic fashion. It also reveals some novel implications for effective control strategies related to emerging diseases, as well as disease outbreak predictions in heterogeneous populations. In conclusion, this study sheds light into the intricate effect that non-linear impulses may have on epidemic progression and emphasizes the importance of adaptive management approaches during an epidemic",1
Use of Recombinant Adenovirus Vectored Consensus IFN-α to Avert Severe Arenavirus Infection,"

This study examines the use of recombinant adenovirus vectored consensus interferon-α (rAdV-CIFNα) to avert severe arenavirus infection. Arenaviruses pose a significant threat to humans and animals alike, but have no effective vaccine or treatment available. While previous studies have used CIFN-α as a prophylactic agent for selected types of virus infections, it remains poorly understood if this cytokine has broad anti-arenaviral effect. The objective of this analysis is to evaluate the efficacy rAdv - CIFC α in counteracting severe arenavirus disease through both laboratory and clinical trials. Reconstructed AdV delivery system provides superior safety profile and potential alternative immunomodulatory approach should be considered against serious infectious diseases such as Zika, Ebola and Marburg Virus Disease. Our results suggest that rAdv – CIFNα treatment can significantly reduce individual susceptibility toward orthopox viral infections when compared with other recently established traditional approaches using conventional IFN-alpha alternatives. Moreover, therapeutic level concentrations may persist even after 72 hours post administration allowing optimization of frequency dosing regimes  These findings could support clinical testing for future consideration are a safe and effective strategy for treating emergent human pathogenic orthopox viruses like Lassa fever in endemic regions which lack comprehensive vaccination programs",1
Automatic Detection and Quantification of Tree-in-Bud (TIB) Opacities from CT Scans,"

This paper presents an accurate, robust and efficient algorithm for the automatic identification and quantification of tree-in-bud (TIB) opacities from computed tomography (CT) scans. The TIB opacity is a complex pattern in pulmonary parenchyma which can be interpreted as an indicator of bronchiolitis, a common respiratory disorder that undermines airway function mainly among children under two years old. As manual detection and analysis of this particular finding is labor intensive, time consuming and subjective to observer's interpretation; therefore automated methods are required in order to reduce time costs while improving reliability levels. In this work we employed modern deep learning techniques based on convolutional neural networks to develop our proposed approach that combines both classification accuracy along with volumetric measurements of the area affected by the pathology related findings; producing valuable results without human intervention thus significantly reducing effort while providing reliable data points for clinical decision making purposes.",1
Group I but not Group II NPV induces antiviral effects in mammalian cells,"

This paper presents an investigation into the antiviral mechanisms of two distinct groups of nucleopolyhedroviruses (NPVs), Group I and Group II NPV, when applied to mammalian cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study that has evaluated these mechanisms in different NPV variants. We found that while both Groups I and II robustly inhibited viral entry into mammalian cells, only Group I demonstrated significant reductions in viral replication, thus pointing towards its ability to induce antiviral effects on a range of host cell types. Our results shed new light on the existing understanding of virus-host interactions and provide a valuable platform for further exploring modulating these pathways with potential therapeutic applications.",1
Role of RNA helicases in HIV-1 replication,"Viruses are replication competent genomes which are relatively gene-poor. Even the largest viruses (i.e. Herpesviruses) encode only slightly >200 open reading frames (ORFs). However, because viruses replicate obligatorily inside cells, and considering that evolution may be driven by a principle of economy of scale, it is reasonable to surmise that many viruses have evolved the ability to co-opt cell-encoded proteins to provide needed surrogate functions. An in silico survey of viral sequence databases reveals that most positive-strand and double-stranded RNA viruses have ORFs for RNA helicases. On the other hand, the genomes of retroviruses are devoid of virally-encoded helicase. Here, we review in brief the notion that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) has adopted the ability to use one or more cellular RNA helicases for its replicative life cycle.",0
Discovery and Targeted LC-MS/MS of Purified Polerovirus Reveals Differences in the Virus-Host Interactome Associated with Altered Aphid Transmission,"

This study presents a breakthrough discovery and targeted LC-MS/MS analysis of a purified polerovirus to uncover differences in the virus-host interactome associated with altered aphid transmission. Using this approach, we identified an array of host proteins that revealed unique insights into the molecular interaction between polerovirus and its vector host. Our results demonstrate the potential for comprehensive investigation into interactions between viruses and their hosts, which can be used to understand disease dynamics or select for enhanced transmission efficiency traits in infectious agents. Furthermore, these findings add further detail to our understanding of key phosphoproteins involved in regulating aphid-virus associations, with implications for integrated pest management strategies targeting vector population control. It is therefore concluded that high resolution proteomics coupled with LC-MS/MS has considerable potential as a powerful tool when investigating viral diseases affecting agriculture.",1
"Multi-faceted, multi-versatile microarray: simultaneous detection of many viruses and their expression profiles","There are hundreds of viruses that infect different human organs and cause diseases. Some fatal emerging viral infections have become serious public health issues worldwide. Early diagnosis and subsequent treatment are therefore essential for fighting viral infections. Current diagnostic techniques frequently employ polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods to quickly detect the pathogenic viruses and establish the etiology of the disease or illness. However, the fast PCR method suffers from many drawbacks such as a high false-positive rate and the ability to detect only one or a few gene targets at a time. Microarray technology solves the problems of the PCR limitations and can be effectively applied to all fields of molecular medicine. Recently, a report in Retrovirology described a multi-virus DNA array that contains more than 250 open reading frames from eight human viruses including human immunodeficiency virus type 1. This array can be used to detect multiple viral co-infections in cells and in vivo. Another benefit of this kind of multi-virus array is in studying promoter activity and viral gene expression and correlating such readouts with the progression of disease and reactivation of latent infections. Thus, the virus DNA-chip development reported in Retrovirology is an important advance in diagnostic application which could be a potent clinical tool for characterizing viral co-infections in AIDS as well as other patients.",0
"Gatekeepers of health: A qualitative assessment of child care centre staff's perspectives, practices and challenges to enteric illness prevention and management in child care centres","BACKGROUND: Enteric outbreaks associated with child care centres (CCC) have been well documented internationally and in Canada. The current literature focuses on identifying potential risk factors for introduction and transmission of enteric disease, but does not examine why these risk factors happen, how the risk is understood and managed by the staff of CCCs, or what challenges they experience responding to enteric illness. The purpose of this study was to explore the understanding, knowledge and actions of CCC staff regarding enteric illness and outbreaks, and to identify challenges that staff encounter while managing them. METHODS: Focus groups were conducted with staff of regulated CCCs in Southern Ontario. Five focus groups were held with 40 participants. An open ended style of interviewing was used. Data were analyzed using content analysis. RESULTS: CCC staff play an important role in preventing and managing enteric illness. Staff used in-depth knowledge of the children, the centre and their personal experiences to assist in making decisions related to enteric illness. The decisions and actions may differ from guidance provided by public health officials, particularly when faced with challenges related to time, money, staffing and parents. CONCLUSION: CCC staff relied on experience and judgment in coordination with public health information to assist decision-making in the management of enteric illness and outbreaks. Advice and guidance from public health officials to CCC staff needs to be consistent yet flexible so that it may be adapted in a variety of situations and meet regulatory and public health requirements.",0
Relevance of human metapneumovirus in exacerbations of COPD,"BACKGROUND AND METHODS: Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a recently discovered respiratory virus associated with bronchiolitis, pneumonia, croup and exacerbations of asthma. Since respiratory viruses are frequently detected in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD (AE-COPD) it was our aim to investigate the frequency of hMPV detection in a prospective cohort of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD compared to patients with stable COPD and to smokers without by means of quantitative real-time RT-PCR. RESULTS: We analysed nasal lavage and induced sputum of 130 patients with AE-COPD, 65 patients with stable COPD and 34 smokers without COPD. HMPV was detected in 3/130 (2.3%) AE-COPD patients with a mean of 6.5 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in nasal lavage and 1.88 × 10(5 )viral copies/ml in induced sputum. It was not found in patients with stable COPD or smokers without COPD. CONCLUSION: HMPV is only found in a very small number of patients with AE-COPD. However it should be considered as a further possible viral trigger of AE-COPD because asymptomatic carriage is unlikely.",0
"New Insights of an Old Defense System: Structure, Function, and Clinical Relevance of the Complement System","The complement system was discovered a century ago as a potent defense cascade of innate immunity. After its first description, continuous experimental and clinical research was performed, and three canonical pathways of activation were established. Upon activation by traumatic or surgical tissue damage, complement reveals beneficial functions of pathogen and danger defense by sensing and clearing injured cells. However, the latest research efforts have provided a more distinct insight into the complement system and its clinical subsequences. Complement has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory processes such as sepsis, multiorgan dysfunction, ischemia/reperfusion, cardiovascular diseases and many others. The three well-known activation pathways of the complement system have been challenged by newer findings that demonstrate direct production of central complement effectors (for example, C5a) by serine proteases of the coagulation cascade. In particular, thrombin is capable of producing C5a, which not only plays a decisive role on pathogens and infected/damaged tissues, but also acts systemically. In the case of uncontrolled complement activation, “friendly fire” is generated, resulting in the destruction of healthy host tissue. Therefore, the traditional research that focuses on a mainly positive-acting cascade has now shifted to the negative effects and how tissue damage originated by the activation of the complement can be contained. In a translational approach including structure-function relations of this ancient defense system, this review provides new insights of complement-mediated clinical relevant diseases and the development of complement modulation strategies and current research aspects.",0
Extrapulmonary tissue responses in cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus,"The mechanisms responsible for virulence of influenza viruses in humans remain poorly understood. A prevailing hypothesis is that the highly pathogenic virus isolates cause a severe cytokinemia precipitating acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) infected with a human highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus isolate (A/Vietnam/1203/2004) or reassortants of human influenza virus A/Texas/36/91 (H1N1) containing genes from the 1918 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus developed severe pneumonia within 24 h postinfection. However, virus spread beyond the lungs was only detected in the H5N1 group, and signs of extrapulmonary tissue reactions, including microglia activation and sustained up-regulation of inflammatory markers, most notably hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), were largely limited to this group. Extrapulmonary pathology may thus contribute to the morbidities induced by H5N1 viruses.",0
Hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome – the markers for an early HSES diagnosis,"BACKGROUND: The hemorrhagic shock and encephalopathy syndrome (HSES) is a devastating disease that affects young children. The outcomes of HSES patients are often fatal or manifesting severe neurological sequelae. We reviewed the markers for an early diagnosis of HSES. METHODS: We examined the clinical, biological and radiological findings of 8 patients (4 months to 9 years old) who met the HSES criteria. RESULTS: Although cerebral edema, disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC), and multiple organ failure were seen in all 8 cases during their clinical courses, brain computed tomography (CT) scans showed normal or only slight edema in 5 patients upon admission. All 8 patients had normal platelet counts, and none were in shock. However, they all had severe metabolic acidosis, which persisted even after 3 hours (median base excess (BE), -7.6 mmol/L). And at 6 hours after admission (BE, -5.7 mmol/L) they required mechanical ventilation. Within 12 hours after admission, fluid resuscitation and vasopressor infusion for hypotension was required. Seven of the patients had elevated liver enzymes and creatine kinase (CK) upon admission. Twenty-four hours after admission, all 8 patients needed vasopressor infusion to maintain blood pressure. CONCLUSION: CT scan, platelet count, hemoglobin level and renal function upon admission are not useful for an early diagnosis of HSES. However, the elevated liver enzymes and CK upon admission, hypotension in the early stage after admission with refractory acid-base disturbance to fluid resuscitation and vasopressor infusion are useful markers for an early HSES diagnosis and helpful to indicate starting intensive neurological treatment.",0
Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Blocks Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase and Nuclear Factor-κB Activation to Downregulate Cytokine Production,"

'Dengue Virus Serotype 2 Blocks Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase and Nuclear Factor-κB Activation to Downregulate Cytokine Production':  Exploring the mechanisms of dengue virus interaction with host cells has contributed to a better understanding of its pathology. Dengue, one of the most prevalent viral diseases worldwide, imposes considerable global health threats due to its associated morbidity and mortality rates. While cellular response pathways activated by dengue have been studied extensively in recent years, the underlying mechanism remains unknown regarding why Dengue serotypes 1-4 behave differently in terms of their severity. In this study, we demonstrated that serotype 2 was able to block ERK and NF-κB activation via altered intracellular Ca2+ mobilization which ultimately resulted in decreased cytokine production. This suggests that further exploration is warranted on how different variates within individual dengue types affect cell signaling patterns and modulation targeting distinct viral infections may prove beneficial against certain strains more effectively than others.",1
Enhanced Hygiene Measures and Norovirus Transmission during an Outbreak,"Control of norovirus outbreaks relies on enhanced hygiene measures, such as handwashing, surface cleaning, using disposable paper towels, and using separate toilets for sick and well persons. However, little is known about their effectiveness in limiting further spread of norovirus infections. We analyzed norovirus outbreaks in 7 camps at an international scouting jamboree in the Netherlands during 2004. Implementation of hygiene measures coincided with an 84.8% (95% predictive interval 81.2%–86.6%) reduction in reproduction number. This reduction was unexpectedly large but still below the reduction needed to contain a norovirus outbreak. Even more stringent control measures are required to break the chain of transmission of norovirus.",0
Diagnosis of influenza viruses with special reference to novel H1N1 2009 influenza virus,"

This paper discusses the diagnosis of influenza viruses with a specific focus on novel H1N1 2009 influenza virus. Since the emergence of this new flu strain, accurate diagnosis has been vital for appropriate management and treatment. Diagnosis can involve virological identification, antigen detection in throat swabs or saliva specimens and nucleic acid based assays using PCR targets from both internal and surface proteins from flu viruses. The current paper reviews existing methods used to diagnose Influenza A infections and specifically investigates strategies currently applied to detect novel H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection. In addition it also provides an overview of indirect test approaches including ELISA’s as well as high throughput techniques such as mass spectrometry. An evaluation is made regarding their limitations, advantages and sensitivity in comparison to traditional diagnostic techniques. Furthermore experimental data evaluates prospective novel biomarkers that may prove useful clinically in terms of diagnosing flu caused by novel H1N1 2009 influenza virus strain accurately while allowing secure patient classification into subgroups based on genetic profiling which can expedite drug target discovery process leading to development of improved therapeutic interventions",1
Transmission patterns of smallpox: systematic review of natural outbreaks in Europe and North America since World War II,"BACKGROUND: Because smallpox (variola major) may be used as a biological weapon, we reviewed outbreaks in post-World War II Europe and North America in order to understand smallpox transmission patterns. METHODS: A systematic review was used to identify papers from the National Library of Medicine, Embase, Biosis, Cochrane Library, Defense Technical Information Center, WorldCat, and reference lists of included publications. Two authors reviewed selected papers for smallpox outbreaks. RESULTS: 51 relevant outbreaks were identified from 1,389 publications. The median for the effective first generation reproduction rate (initial R) was 2 (range 0–38). The majority outbreaks were small (less than 5 cases) and contained within one generation. Outbreaks with few hospitalized patients had low initial R values (median of 1) and were prolonged if not initially recognized (median of 3 generations); outbreaks with mostly hospitalized patients had higher initial R values (median 12) and were shorter (median of 3 generations). Index cases with an atypical presentation of smallpox were less likely to have been diagnosed with smallpox; outbreaks in which the index case was not correctly diagnosed were larger (median of 27.5 cases) and longer (median of 3 generations) compared to outbreaks in which the index case was correctly diagnosed (median of 3 cases and 1 generation). CONCLUSION: Patterns of spread during Smallpox outbreaks varied with circumstances, but early detection and implementation of control measures is a most important influence on the magnitude of outbreaks. The majority of outbreaks studied in Europe and North America were controlled within a few generations if detected early.",0
Myometrial cavernous hemangioma with pulmonary thromboembolism in a post-partum woman: a case report and review of the literature," 

This paper will discuss a case study of Myometrial Cavernous Hemangioma with Pulmonary Thromboembolism (PTE) in post-partum woman. The case is important as it outlines the clinical signs and symptoms which led to correct diagnosis, and aims to lend insight into this uncommon combination of pathologies seen in post-partum women through discussion of review the available literature. Whilst an increasing number of similar diagnoses have been reported over recent years, the exact mechanisms contributing to their occurrence remain largely unknown. This paper seeks to support evidence based practice amongst healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis, management and treatment of this condition. The purpose is also to raise awareness among obstetricians and gynecologists so that they can more efficiently diagnose cases when they present themselves, thereby reducing misdiagnoses or delays in recognition of PTE with Myometrial Cavernous Hemangiomas associated with pregnancy related events such as labor or delivery.

"Seasonal influenza risk in hospital healthcare workers is more strongly associated with household than occupational exposures: results from a prospective cohort study in Berlin, Germany, 2006/07","BACKGROUND: Influenza immunisation for healthcare workers is encouraged to protect their often vulnerable patients but also due to a perceived higher risk for influenza. We aimed to compare the risk of influenza infection in healthcare workers in acute hospital care with that in non-healthcare workers over the same season. METHODS: We conducted a prospective, multicentre cohort study during the 2006/07 influenza season in Berlin, Germany. Recruited participants gave serum samples before and after the season, and completed questionnaires to determine their relevant exposures and possible confounding factors. The main outcome measure was serologically confirmed influenza infection (SCII), defined as a fourfold or greater rise in haemagglutination inhibition antibody titres to a circulating strain of influenza (with post-season titre at least 1:40). Weekly mobile phone text messages were used to prompt participants to report respiratory illnesses during the influenza season. A logistic regression model was used to assess the influence of potential risk factors. RESULTS: We recruited 250 hospital healthcare workers (mean age 35.7 years) and 486 non-healthcare workers (mean age 39.2 years) from administrative centres, blood donors and colleges. Overall SCII attack rate was 10.6%. Being a healthcare worker was not a risk factor for SCII (relative risk 1.1, p = 0.70). The final multivariate model had three significant factors: living with children (odds ratio [OR] 3.7, p = 0.005), immunization (OR 0.50, p = 0.02), and - among persons living in households without children - ownership of a car (OR 3.0, p = 0.02). Living with three or more children (OR 13.8, p < 0.01) was a greater risk than living with one or two children (OR 5.3, p = 0.02). 30% of participants with SCII reported no respiratory illness. Healthcare workers were at slightly higher risk of reporting any respiratory infection than controls (adjusted OR 1.3, p = 0.04, n = 850). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that healthcare workers in hospitals do not have a higher risk of influenza than non-healthcare workers, although their risk of any respiratory infection is slightly raised. Household contacts seem to be more important than exposure to patients. Car ownership is a surprise finding which needs further exploration. Asymptomatic infections are common, accounting for around a third of serologically confirmed infections.",0
Influence of Mabs on PrP(Sc) Formation Using In Vitro and Cell-Free Systems,"

This paper details the research into the role of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) on prion protein aggregates known as PrP(Sc) formation in both in vitro and cell-free systems. The mechanisms by which mAbs can modulate prion viral replication and infectivity are not completely understood, however recent evidence suggests biological pathways beyond their direct effect on PrP(Sc). This study aimed to examine the impact of combining five different classes of mabs on PrP formation using a novel nitrocellulose filter assay combined with biochemical assessment. Results suggest that there is variability amongst individual mAb’s anti-prion properties, with some having an inhibitory effect while others appear to promote it. In addition, several variables such as antibody class or combinations were found to influence PrP(Sc) aggregation over time. Our findings indicate significant potential variation amongst distinct antibodies towards regulating PrP aggregates suggesting possible therapeutic benefit against prion diseases.",1
Prediction and Identification of T Cell Epitopes in the H5N1 Influenza Virus Nucleoprotein in Chicken,"

This study examines the prediction and identification of T cell epitopes in nucleoprotein from the H5N1 strain of Avian influenza virus. The findings presented here show how molecular modelling can be used to determine possible antigenic responses in chickens, by detecting potential T cell epitope structures, taking into consideration stability and flexibility as important parameters for successful immunization strategies. With a constantly evolving avian influenza virus causing diseases that range from mild respiratory infections to pandemic outbreaks with high mortality rates, this analysis seeks to provide further insight into protection against infected poultry through methods like vaccination. Through sequence-based bioinformatics algorithms such as Ellipro, ABCPred and SVM, combined with screening biological assays such as ELISA and peptide synthesis libraries employed on a modified ADI 1.2 system; this work successfully identified three optimal candidate peptides which will serve as valuable tools when designing efficient immunological interventions for control of chicken birds affected by H5N1 virus variations.",1
Clarithromycin Suppresses Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infection-Induced Streptococcus pneumoniae Adhesion and Cytokine Production in a Pulmonary Epithelial Cell Line,"

This study investigates the potential of Clarithromycin to reduce Human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) -induced Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) adhesion and cytokine production in a pulmonary epithelial cell line. It has been previously established that RSV increases SP adherence within the respiratory tract, however, no antiviral or antibiotic treatment strategies have been identified capable of suppressing this process. This research draws upon existing literature to identify if Clarithromycin is an appropriate medication for reducing SP-RSV interactions in order to determine a more effective approach for treating pathogen invasions in future situations. The results obtained from these experiments could provide a foundation for further analysis into antiviral therapy tailored towards lung infections caused by rotavirus and other virus types.",1
Predicting intention to treat HIV-infected patients among Tanzanian and Sudanese medical and dental students using the theory of planned behaviour - a cross sectional study,"BACKGROUND: The HIV epidemic poses significant challenges to the low income countries in sub Saharan Africa (SSA), affecting the attrition rate among health care workers, their level of motivation, and absenteeism from work. Little is known about how to deal with deterioration of human resources in the health care systems. This study aimed to predict the intention to provide surgical treatment to HIV infected patients among medical- and dental students in Tanzania and Sudan using an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB). METHODS: Four hundred and seventy five medical- and dental students at the University of Dar es Salaam (mean age, 25 yr) and 642 dental students attending 6 public and private dental faculties in Khartoum (mean age 21.7 yr) completed self-administered TPB questionnaires in 2005 and 2007, respectively. RESULTS: Both Tanzanian and Sudanese students demonstrated strong intentions to provide care for people with HIV and AIDS. Stepwise linear regression revealed that the TPB accounted for 51% (43% in Tanzania and Sudan) of the variance in intention across study sites. After having controlled for country and past behaviour, the TPB in terms of attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control accounted for 34% and moral norms for an additional 2,3% of the explainable variance in intention. Across both study sites, attitudes were the strongest predictor of intention followed in descending order by subjective norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control. CONCLUSION: The TPB is applicable to students' care delivery intentions in the context of HIV and AIDS across the two SSA countries investigated. It is suggested that attitudes, subjective norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control are key factors in students' willingness to treat AIDS and HIV infected patients and should be targets of interventions aimed at improving the quality of health care delivery in this context.",0
Autophagy: More Than a Nonselective Pathway,"

Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular process that plays an extremely important role in homeostatic adaptation and nutrient acquisition. This review discusses the advancement of our current understanding about autophagy beyond its classical definition as a merely nonselective degradation pathway, and instead argues for it to be viewed as multifaceted molecular machinery with diverse functions from energy metabolism to aging and development. Firstly, this paper aims to highlight recent findings which suggest that tissues may select specific cargoes due to their ability of actively respond towards external signals or physiological stimuli. Secondly, we focus on regulatory layers underlining the modulation of autophagic activity at different cell types including specialized cells concerning autolysosomal cargo sorting mechanisms unique for each tissue. Lastly, we explore both protective roles regulating life-span through alterations assuring normal protein turnover together with maladaptive contributions driving disease pathogenesis via misregulation of cargoes undergoing wild dispositive pathways when turned deregulated such not only in humans but also animals revealing interesting parallelism between species highlighting the complexity nested within said processes.",1
Emerging zoonotic diseases: An opportunity to apply the concepts of nidality and one-medicine,"The use of animals as sentinels of human disease revolves around the concept of nidality. That is, an agent of disease occupies a particular ecologic niche and alterations in that niche will change the function of that agent relative to traditional host-agent-environment relationships. Nidality is a derivation of the root word nidus. Nidus is defined as a nest or breeding place, particularly a place where microbes such as bacteria, fungi, viruses, as well as other organisms and larger parasites, are located and multiply. Application of the concept of nidality and development of prevention strategies has most frequently been associated with military campaigns and interruption of tick-borne infections. Modern usage of the phrase “one-medicine” was popularized in the United States and Europe by Calvin Schwabe and the concept is attributed to Rudolph Virchow. It is applied today to the study of zoonotic disease and interventions in rural agricultural communities that share close living arrangements between people and their families, their pastoral work environment, and the animals for which they care. Integration of the two concepts of one-medicine and nidality provides an opportunity to apply a systems approach (i.e. general systems theory) to dealing with emerging zoonotic diseases in today’s global agricultural and industrial settings.",0
Clinical review: Special populations - critical illness and pregnancy,"

This clinical review aims to explore the unique health risks and vulnerabilities of special populations, focusing specifically on critical illness in pregnant women. With advances in medicine offering new possibilities for both expecting mothers and ill patients, it is essential that clinicians holistically consider outcomes when considering treatments. While considerable research has been conducted on certain conditions – such as pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes and hyperemesis gravidarum – there is a need to appreciate the interrelatedness between critical illnesses (e.g., cancer) with pregnancy itself; this complexity necessitates an integrated approach to care provision and medical decision making amongst practitioners specializing in these fields. After summarizing current evidence from a range of sources, conclusions are drawn on the limitations of existing practices and suggestions for best practice are made. It is concluded that a holistic attitude must be adopted by all stakeholders during treatment which takes into account psychosocial factors especially if long term desired outcomes are to be achieved within these patient types.",1
Broadly cross-reactive antibodies dominate the human B cell response against 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infection,"The 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza pandemic demonstrated the global health threat of reassortant influenza strains. Herein, we report a detailed analysis of plasmablast and monoclonal antibody responses induced by pandemic H1N1 infection in humans. Unlike antibodies elicited by annual influenza vaccinations, most neutralizing antibodies induced by pandemic H1N1 infection were broadly cross-reactive against epitopes in the hemagglutinin (HA) stalk and head domain of multiple influenza strains. The antibodies were from cells that had undergone extensive affinity maturation. Based on these observations, we postulate that the plasmablasts producing these broadly neutralizing antibodies were predominantly derived from activated memory B cells specific for epitopes conserved in several influenza strains. Consequently, most neutralizing antibodies were broadly reactive against divergent H1N1 and H5N1 influenza strains. This suggests that a pan-influenza vaccine may be possible, given the right immunogen. Antibodies generated potently protected and rescued mice from lethal challenge with pandemic H1N1 or antigenically distinct influenza strains, making them excellent therapeutic candidates.",0
The intracellular dynamic of protein palmitoylation,"S-palmitoylation describes the reversible attachment of fatty acids (predominantly palmitate) onto cysteine residues via a labile thioester bond. This posttranslational modification impacts protein functionality by regulating membrane interactions, intracellular sorting, stability, and membrane micropatterning. Several recent findings have provided a tantalizing insight into the regulation and spatiotemporal dynamics of protein palmitoylation. In mammalian cells, the Golgi has emerged as a possible super-reaction center for the palmitoylation of peripheral membrane proteins, whereas palmitoylation reactions on post-Golgi compartments contribute to the regulation of specific substrates. In addition to palmitoylating and depalmitoylating enzymes, intracellular palmitoylation dynamics may also be controlled through interplay with distinct posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and nitrosylation.",0
Accumulation of noradrenaline and its oxidation products by cultured rodent astrocytes,"

""Accumulation of noradrenaline and its oxidation products by cultured rodent astrocytes"" provides a comprehensive view into the role of oxidative stress in neuronal pathways. Astrocytes, as key contributors to brain homeostasis, play a pivotal role in maintaining physiological balance within localized environments. This study investigates the accumulation capability of noradrenaline (NA) along with its text products when exposed to rat neuron-glial primary cell cultures derived from hippocampus tissues of adult Sprague-Dawley rats. A specially adapted high performance liquid chromatography was used to measure levels of NA and its derivatives in astrocyte cultures under control as well as experimental conditions, while immunocytochemistry further supported results obtained through fluorescence microscopy staining technique. Results confirmed that expression capacity for NA is indeed greater than basal stereoisomers no matter the culture condition applied, which indicates that upregulation or downregulation does not impact significantly on this factor. Furthermore oxide metabolites were documented at 7 pmol/108 cells although their effects remain equivocal yet could provide insight into future studies related to reactive oxygen species detoxifying capabilities assessed through enzymatic activities such assuperoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase testing upon cultured cortical astrocytes post oxidative stimulus exposure.",1
Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide is a functional receptor for human hepatitis B and D virus,"

This study investigates the role of Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) in mediating infection by human hepatitis B and D virus. NTCP is a crucial receptor involved in hepatic uptake that was traditionally thought to be responsible for bile acid absorption only, until our findings demonstrated its association with viral entry. A combination of techniques such as confocal microscopy, cell culture assays, western blotting was used to examine if NTCP acts as an authentic functional binding protein for these viruses and subsequently triggers their replication processes in vitro. We further elucidate mechanistic elements at play by analyzing patterns of gene expression before and after exposure to viruses during both probe-based assays as well as siRNA-mediated knockdown experiments. Our results indicate that NTCP functions not only as a receptor molecule facilitating virus-host interaction but also regulates downstream pathways associated with progression from early stages of infection up to virus elimination in cells post infection.",1
First Discovery and Stucture-Activity Relationship Study of Phenanthroquinolizidines as Novel Antiviral Agents against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV),"

This study reports the successful identification and structure-activity relationship (SAR) investigation of phenanthroquinolizidines as a novel antiviral agent against Tobacco Mosaic Virus (TMV). Using computational methods, 18 phenanthroquinolizidine derivatives were synthesized and evaluated for their activity against TMV. Of these compounds, two exhibited promising inhibitory activities with abilities to block viral assembly in Agrobacterium tumefaciens and reduce disease symptoms on Nicotiana benthamiana. Structural modification studies together with molecular modeling greatly provided insight into the interactions between the molecules and active sites of TMV resulting in recommendations for further optimization efforts. This is groundbreaking work with potential implications for natural product drug discovery concerning methods aimed at controlling plant virus diseases.",1
Escape from Autologous Neutralizing Antibodies in Acute/Early Subtype C HIV-1 Infection Requires Multiple Pathways,"One aim for an HIV vaccine is to elicit neutralizing antibodies (Nab) that can limit replication of genetically diverse viruses and prevent establishment of a new infection. Thus, identifying the strengths and weaknesses of Nab during the early stages of natural infection could prove useful in achieving this goal. Here we demonstrate that viral escape readily occurred despite the development of high titer autologous Nab in two subjects with acute/early subtype C infection. To provide a detailed portrayal of the escape pathways, Nab resistant variants identified at multiple time points were used to create a series of envelope (Env) glycoprotein chimeras and mutants within the background of a corresponding newly transmitted Env. In one subject, Nab escape was driven predominantly by changes in the region of gp120 that extends from the beginning of the V3 domain to the end of the V5 domain (V3V5). However, Nab escape pathways in this subject oscillated and at times required cooperation between V1V2 and the gp41 ectodomain. In the second subject, escape was driven by changes in V1V2. This V1V2-dependent escape pathway was retained over time, and its utility was reflected in the virus's ability to escape from two distinct monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) derived from this same patient via introduction of a single potential N-linked glycosylation site in V2. Spatial representation of the sequence changes in gp120 suggested that selective pressure acted upon the same regions of Env in these two subjects, even though the Env domains that drove escape were different. Together the findings argue that a single mutational pathway is not sufficient to confer escape in early subtype C HIV-1 infection, and support a model in which multiple strategies, including potential glycan shifts, direct alteration of an epitope sequence, and cooperative Env domain conformational masking, are used to evade neutralization.",0
Avian Influenza: Should China Be Alarmed?,"Avian influenza has emerged as one of the primary public health concern of the 21st century. Influenza strain H5N1 is capable of incidentally infecting humans and other mammals. Since their reemergence in 2003, highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses have been transmitted from poultry to humans (by direct or indirect contact with infected birds) in several provinces of Mainland China, which has resulted in 22 cases of human infection and has created repercussions for the Chinese economy. People have been concerned whether a new pandemic will occur in the future. The eradication of pathogenic avian influenza viruses appears to be the most effective way to prevent an influenza pandemic. This paper will examine the features of H5N1, including incidence, infection, immunity, clinical management, prevention and control, and therapy in Mainland China.",0
Investigating selection on viruses: a statistical alignment approach,"BACKGROUND: Two problems complicate the study of selection in viral genomes: Firstly, the presence of genes in overlapping reading frames implies that selection in one reading frame can bias our estimates of neutral mutation rates in another reading frame. Secondly, the high mutation rates we are likely to encounter complicate the inference of a reliable alignment of genomes. To address these issues, we develop a model that explicitly models selection in overlapping reading frames. We then integrate this model into a statistical alignment framework, enabling us to estimate selection while explicitly dealing with the uncertainty of individual alignments. We show that in this way we obtain un-biased selection parameters for different genomic regions of interest, and can improve in accuracy compared to using a fixed alignment. RESULTS: We run a series of simulation studies to gauge how well we do in selection estimation, especially in comparison to the use of a fixed alignment. We show that the standard practice of using a ClustalW alignment can lead to considerable biases and that estimation accuracy increases substantially when explicitly integrating over the uncertainty in inferred alignments. We even manage to compete favourably for general evolutionary distances with an alignment produced by GenAl. We subsequently run our method on HIV2 and Hepatitis B sequences. CONCLUSION: We propose that marginalizing over all alignments, as opposed to using a fixed one, should be considered in any parametric inference from divergent sequence data for which the alignments are not known with certainty. Moreover, we discover in HIV2 that double coding regions appear to be under less stringent selection than single coding ones. Additionally, there appears to be evidence for differential selection, where one overlapping reading frame is under positive and the other under negative selection.",0
A Human Monoclonal Antibody with Neutralizing Activity against Highly Divergent Influenza Subtypes,"

This study presents the characterization of a novel human monoclonal antibody (hMAb) with potent, broadly neutralizing activity across common influenza subtypes. Through functional and biochemical characterization of this hMAb, named IG5410, we demonstrate that it can effectively recognize diverse influenza proteins containing variable antigenic regions found in highly divergent cage A subtypes. Fusion-format assays using spike protein receptors revealed that IG5410 is a strong binding epitope with an effective IC50 concentration down to 2 μg/mL against multiple H3N2 and H1N1 isolates collected over 10 years range. Thus, IG5410 may represent an alternative approach for protection against potentially emerging influenza pandemics by providing coverage across different circulating or mutated strains.",1
Comparative analysis of mycobacterium and related actinomycetes yields insight into the evolution of mycobacterium tuberculosis pathogenesis,"

This paper presents comparative analysis of Mycobacterium and related Actinomycetes to define a deep understanding of the evolution of pathogenesis within Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recent advancements in genomics were employed during this investigation to identify key characteristics associated with pathogenicity, providing valuable insight into past evolutionary processes that led to highly successful infectious agents. Through intensive phylogenetic reconstruction and sequence-based approaches, our study reveals important genomic features associated with the bacteria's transmittable nature in a population-wide context. Further research questioning mechanisms attributed to disease progression is then posed which will allow for further insights into how species adapt over time through mutation and selection pressures when exposed to various environments. We also discuss correlations between genomic properties, geographic location data and transmission pathways, as these have not yet been adequately investigated. As such, our findings stimulate an informed debate about community structure formation amongst all mycobacterial genera across different environmental contexts leading up to emergence of new diseases from old ones, an area where far more interrogation is needed given modern times heightened rate of genetic exchange through microbial expression on global scales today parallel never seen before in history",1
SYSGENET: a meeting report from a new European network for systems genetics,"The first scientific meeting of the newly established European SYSGENET network took place at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research (HZI) in Braunschweig, April 7-9, 2010. About 50 researchers working in the field of systems genetics using mouse genetic reference populations (GRP) participated in the meeting and exchanged their results, phenotyping approaches, and data analysis tools for studying systems genetics. In addition, the future of GRP resources and phenotyping in Europe was discussed.",0
The Sigma Class Glutathione Transferase from the Liver Fluke Fasciola hepatica,"

The Sigma Class Glutathione Transferase from the Liver Fluke Fasciola hepatica: Shedding Light on Evolutionary Pathways

Glutathione transferases (GSTs) are a family of structural enzymes that play a central role in cellular redox chemistry. Recently, it has been found that the freshwater liver fluke parasitoid Fasciola hepatica possesses at least two sigmeclass GSTs named Fh1-GST and Fh2-GST. In order to gain further insight into the evolutionary origins of this class of GST, we have studied both genes experimentally. Our data shows evidence for significant signatures associated with positive selection invoked by natural selection within each gene throughout their evolution . Further analysis showed highly conserved characteristics such as structure and function among related members from other species and phyla despite considerable sequence diversity between them. This work serves to expand our understanding of sigma-class GST evolution, providing support for convergent or homoplastic evolution through recombinant exon shuffling along different lineages as opposed adaptive pressures from varied environments driving divergent patterns in distantly related organisms having similar metabolic pathways..",1
Apolipoprotein M Gene (APOM) Polymorphism Modifies Metabolic and Disease Traits in Type 2 Diabetes,"This study aimed at substantiating the associations of the apolipoproein M gene (APOM) with type 2 diabetes (T2D) as well as with metabolic traits in Hong Kong Chinese. In addition, APOM gene function was further characterized to elucidate its activity in cholesterol metabolism. Seventeen APOM SNPs documented in the NCBI database were genotyped. Five SNPs were confirmed in our study cohort of 1234 T2D and 606 control participants. Three of the five SNPs rs707921(C+1871A), rs707922(G+1837T) and rs805264(G+203A) were in linkage disequilibrium (LD). We chose rs707922 to tag this LD region for down stream association analyses and characterized the function of this SNP at molecular level. No association between APOM and T2D susceptibility was detected in our Hong Kong Chinese cohort. Interestingly, the C allele of rs805297 was significantly associated with T2D duration of longer than 10 years (OR = 1.245, p = 0.015). The rs707922 TT genotype was significantly associated with elevated plasma total- and LDL- cholesterol levels (p = 0.006 and p = 0.009, respectively) in T2D patients. Molecular analyses of rs707922 lead to the discoveries of a novel transcript APOM5 as well as the cryptic nature of exon 5 of the gene. Ectopic expression of APOM5 transcript confirmed rs707922 allele-dependent activity of the transcript in modifying cholesterol homeostasis in vitro. In conclusion, the results here did not support APOM as a T2D susceptibility gene in Hong Kong Chinese. However, in T2D patients, a subset of APOM SNPs was associated with disease duration and metabolic traits. Further molecular analysis proved the functional activity of rs707922 in APOM expression and in regulation of cellular cholesterol content.",0
The expression of nicotinic receptor alpha7 during cochlear development," 

This paper discusses the role of nicotinic receptor alpha7 (α7 nAChR) and its expression during cochlear development. The aim is to provide insight into the regulation of this transcription factor, as well as its importance in hearing pathways. Using reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR), immunohistochemistry analysis, cell culture assays, western blotting and scatter plot correlation techniques, α7 nAChR expression during mouse cochlea development was explored. Results demonstrated significantly varying levels of α7 binding throughout the gestational process, with a remarkable change observed on postnatal day 14 compared to day 25 in both experimental groups. Microscopic examination presented distinct labeling patterns based on different developmental periods, suggesting that selective regions might possess resistance or sensitivity towards α7 nAChRs at certain time points in the vital period for hearing formation. Our results are promising and provide insights into how alterations within ""nicotinic cotransmission"" could contribute to inner ear diseases when subunits such as α7nAChRs vary inappropriately due to environmental factors or gene mutations .

"Clinical characteristics of pediatric hospitalizations associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Northern Bavaria, Germany","

This study explored the clinical characteristics of pediatric hospitalizations associated with 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Northern Bavaria, Germany. Using a retrospective observational design, medical records from 2009-2010 of children aged 0 to <18 years who were hospitalized and had a diagnosis of pandemic influenza A (H1N1), were reviewed using specially developed data collection forms. The objective was twofold 1) to describe the demographic and clinical features of patients who received treatment for H1N1 infection in a northern region German population; 2) to provide detailed information on epidemiological trends during this period. Results showed that febrile respiratory symptoms such as coughing and sore throat occurred most often, followed by wheezing/chest pain, nausea/vomiting, muscle aches/pains, earache/ear discharge and nasal congestion. This highlights the importance for clinicians to be aware that minor or unusual signs may also appear among children at risk for H1N1 related illnesses requiring specialized care or intervention. It is hoped that these findings will inform strategies tailored towards targeted preventative measures associated with early detection in response to similar incidences of disease outbreak or re-occurrence in other regions or countries.",1
Cell-penetrating peptides as transporters for morpholino oligomers: effects of amino acid composition on intracellular delivery and cytotoxicity,"Arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) are promising transporters for intracellular delivery of antisense morpholino oligomers (PMO). Here, we determined the effect of L-arginine, D-arginine and non-α amino acids on cellular uptake, splice-correction activity, cellular toxicity and serum binding for 24 CPP−PMOs. Insertion of 6-aminohexanoic acid (X) or β-alanine (B) residues into oligoarginine R(8) decreased the cellular uptake but increased the splice-correction activity of the resulting compound, with a greater increase for the sequences containing more X residues. Cellular toxicity was not observed for any of the conjugates up to 10 μM. Up to 60 μM, only the conjugates with ⩾ 5 Xs exhibited time- and concentration-dependent toxicity. Substitution of L-arginine with D-arginine did not increase uptake or splice-correction activity. High concentration of serum significantly decreased the uptake and splice-correction activity of oligoarginine conjugates, but had much less effect on the conjugates containing X or B. In summary, incorporation of X/B into oligoarginine enhanced the antisense activity and serum-binding profile of CPP−PMO. Toxicity of X/B-containing conjugates was affected by the number of Xs, treatment time and concentration. More active, stable and less toxic CPPs can be designed by optimizing the position and number of R, D-R, X and B residues.",0
Essential epidemiological mechanisms underpinning the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza,"

This paper provides an exposition of the essential epidemiological mechanisms underpinning the transmission dynamics of seasonal influenza. Each year, Infectious diseases such as influenza viruses infect billions globally, with significant mortality and morbidity rates worldwide, resulting from severe complications associated with Influenza A virus infection. This highlights the need for a comprehensive understanding of their transmission dynamics in order to reduce risk, configure control interventions and minimise healthcare expenditure. We present a review of key epidemiological mechanisms which are fundamental to understanding transmission dynamics of seasonally occurring influenza strains: host susceptibility; transmissibility; population immunity (herd immunity); seasonal cycles associated with geography; and temperature-dependent tick-over returns that influence persistence or extinction. Additionally, we assess how these processes interact to distort transmission patterns thereof. We also showcase real world applications where combined knowledge has enabled decision makers to predict future outbreaks and set precautionary strategies based on observed historical data trends while pushing boundaries so as to eventually eliminate vaccine-preventable morbimortality due to seasonal Influenza A viruses in high density populations around the globe",1
The Battle between Virus and Host: Modulation of Toll-Like Receptor Signaling Pathways by Virus Infection,"In order to establish an infection, viruses need to either suppress or escape from host immune defense systems. Recent immunological research has focused on innate immunity as the first line of host defense, especially pattern recognition molecules such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and NOD-like receptors (NLRs). Various microbial components are recognized by their vague and common molecular shapes so-called, pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs induce inflammatory reactions mediated by the activation of the transcription factor, NF-κB, and by interferons, which lead to an antiviral immune response. Viruses have the capacity to suppress or escape from this pattern recognition molecule-mediated antimicrobial response in various ways. In this paper, we review the various strategies used by viruses to modulate the pattern recognition molecule-mediated innate immune response.",0
Nitric oxide: a pro-inflammatory mediator in lung disease?,"Inflammatory diseases of the respiratory tract are commonly associated with elevated production of nitric oxide (NO•) and increased indices of NO• -dependent oxidative stress. Although NO• is known to have anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant properties, various lines of evidence support the contribution of NO• to lung injury in several disease models. On the basis of biochemical evidence, it is often presumed that such NO• -dependent oxidations are due to the formation of the oxidant peroxynitrite, although alternative mechanisms involving the phagocyte-derived heme proteins myeloperoxidase and eosinophil peroxidase might be operative during conditions of inflammation. Because of the overwhelming literature on NO• generation and activities in the respiratory tract, it would be beyond the scope of this commentary to review this area comprehensively. Instead, it focuses on recent evidence and concepts of the presumed contribution of NO• to inflammatory diseases of the lung.",0
QSAR for RNases and theoretic–experimental study of molecular diversity on peptide mass fingerprints of a new Leishmania infantum protein,"

This article introduces a new methodology for calculating the quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) of ribonuclease enzymes and presents an in-depth theoretical–experimental study of the peptide mass fingerprints (PMF) derived from a newly identified protein from Leishmania infantum. Using this novel approach, QSAR can be used to predict thermodynamic parameters relevant to drug development such as binding affinities and catalytic efficiencies with high accuracy. To further demonstrate its capability, PMF was used to elucidate molecular diversity among related proteins that have similar basic sequence composition. Through this investigation, we seek to gain insights into structural and functional similarities among RNase enzymes with varying properties for use in biotechnological systems engineering applications. The results will provide additional understanding of both natural and genetically engineered RNases which could benefit medical research.?",1
Novel Approaches to Vaccine Delivery," 

This study intends to show that novel approaches to vaccine delivery are necessary in the current changing circumstances worldwide. Vaccine delivery systems must be able to cope with rapidly changing demands, cultural specificities and the need for rapid international scalability while providing equitable access. In this paper we will review a range of existing novel approaches to vaccine delivery which have successfully been implemented, and suggest potential solutions for future challenges associated with them. Lastly, policy suggestions based on impactful advice from both public health officials as well as local stakeholders shall be discussed in order to provide recommendations and guidance when considering possible changes. Novel Approaches to Vaccine Delivery looks into different contexts and offers further insight for those looking for new methods of providing safe and effective vaccination coverage across demographics regardless of geographical location or social status.",1
Towards cross-lingual alerting for bursty epidemic events,"

This paper presents a novel approach to cross-lingual alerting for bursty epidemic events using natural language processing techniques. In this work, we introduce the concept of ‘Cross-Lingual Epidemic Event Alerts’ – a platform that enables epidemiological organizations to take proactive measures in responding to potential epidemic threats in different languages by providing timely notifications and alerts. The data sources used are from public content available on social media platforms such as Twitter and news articles gathered from multiple languages like English, Spanish, French and German etc. Through a combination of machine learning classification models with linguistic features extracted via statistical methods such as Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)topic modelling, our proposed platform has been able to detect anomalous patterns related to surge of relevant topic categories (including health phrases), so as to identify suspicious emerging diseases accurately across languages with high accuracy scores. Additionally personalized mobile push notification messages are also sent out by following user interests on chosen topics while filtering low relevance or unrelated tweets since native speakers understand nuances better than machines due to cultural context understanding capabilities held by humans.",1
Positional clustering improves computational binding site detection and identifies novel cis-regulatory sites in mammalian GABA(A) receptor subunit genes,"Understanding transcription factor (TF) mediated control of gene expression remains a major challenge at the interface of computational and experimental biology. Computational techniques predicting TF-binding site specificity are frequently unreliable. On the other hand, comprehensive experimental validation is difficult and time consuming. We introduce a simple strategy that dramatically improves robustness and accuracy of computational binding site prediction. First, we evaluate the rate of recurrence of computational TFBS predictions by commonly used sampling procedures. We find that the vast majority of results are biologically meaningless. However clustering results based on nucleotide position improves predictive power. Additionally, we find that positional clustering increases robustness to long or imperfectly selected input sequences. Positional clustering can also be used as a mechanism to integrate results from multiple sampling approaches for improvements in accuracy over each one alone. Finally, we predict and validate regulatory sequences partially responsible for transcriptional control of the mammalian type A γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA(A)R) subunit genes. Positional clustering is useful for improving computational binding site predictions, with potential application to improving our understanding of mammalian gene expression. In particular, predicted regulatory mechanisms in the mammalian GABA(A)R subunit gene family may open new avenues of research towards understanding this pharmacologically important neurotransmitter receptor system.",0
Results From a Hypothesis Generating Case-Control Study: Herpes Family Viruses and Schizophrenia Among Military Personnel,"Background: Herpes family viruses can cause central nervous system inflammatory changes that can present with symptoms indistinguishable from schizophrenia and therefore are of interest in schizophrenia research. Most existing studies of herpes viruses have used small populations and postdiagnosis specimens. As part of a larger research program, we conducted a hypothesis-generating case-control study of selected herpes virus antibodies among individuals discharged from the US military with schizophrenia and pre- and postdiagnosis sera. Methods: Cases (n = 180) were servicemembers hospitalized and discharged from military service with schizophrenia. Controls, 3:1 matched on several factors, were members not discharged. The military routinely collects and stores members' serum specimens. We used microplate enzyme immunoassay to measure immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody levels to 6 herpes viruses in pre- and postdiagnosis specimens. Conditional logistic regression was used, and the measure of association was the hazard ratio (HR). Results: Overall, we found a significant association between human herpes virus type 6 and schizophrenia, with an HR of 1.17 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.04, 1.32). Women and blacks had significant negative associations with herpes simplex virus type 2 and cytomegalovirus; among blacks, there was a significant positive association with herpes simplex virus type 1. Among men, there was a HHV-6 temporal effect with an HR of 1.41 (95% CI = 1.02, 1.96) for sera drawn 6–12 months before diagnosis. Discussion: Findings from previous studies of herpes family viruses and schizophrenia have been inconsistent. Our study is based on a larger population than most previous studies and used serum specimens collected before onset of illness. This study adds to the body of knowledge and provides testable hypotheses for follow-on studies.",0
A universal BMV-based RNA recombination system—how to search for general rules in RNA recombination,"At present, there is no doubt that RNA recombination is one of the major factors responsible for the generation of new RNA viruses and retroviruses. Numerous experimental systems have been created to investigate this complex phenomenon. Consequently, specific RNA structural motifs mediating recombination have been identified in several viruses. Unfortunately, up till now a unified model of genetic RNA recombination has not been formulated, mainly due to difficulties with the direct comparison of data obtained for different RNA-based viruses. To solve this problem, we have attempted to construct a universal system in which the recombination activity of various RNA sequences could be tested. To this end, we have used brome mosaic virus, a model (+)RNA virus of plants, for which the structural requirements of RNA recombination are well defined. The effectiveness of the new homomolecular system has been proven in an experiment involving two RNA sequences derived from the hepatitis C virus genome. In addition, comparison of the data obtained with the homomolecular system with those generated earlier using the heteromolecular one has provided new evidence that the mechanisms of homologous and non-homologous recombination are different and depend on the virus' mode of replication.",0
Serum Levels of Gelatinase Associated Lipocalin as Indicator of the Inflammatory Status in Coronary Artery Disease,"

This study examines the correlation between serum levels of gelatinase associated lipocalin (GAL) and inflammatory status in coronary artery disease (CAD). CAD is a major health concern, with over 17.9 million deaths reported annually caused by this condition, one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. Studies have found that inflammation plays an important role in the development of CAD; hence understanding its relationship to GAL can provide us with more insights for managing this debilitating cardiovascular illness. This paper reviews past research on GAL levels and their potential as a biomarker for inflammatory processes involved in CAD, then investigates whether higher values are linked to greater risk or better outcomes among patients presenting with symptoms compatible with these conditions. Data from multiple studies conducted around the world are utilized to evaluate correlations between GAL levels, inflammation markers, and clinical features of CAD such as chest pain intensity or angina stability over time. The results will be discussed to draw implications for how increased knowledge of GAL dynamics may assist physicians in assessing disease progression more accurately so effective intervention methods can be designed to improve patient management going forward.",1
Plasmacytoid Dendritic Cells and the Control of Herpesvirus Infections,"

This paper explores the mechanisms by which a subset of immune cells known as plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) influence herpesvirus infections. As viruses that cause numerous illnesses including cold sores, chicken pox, and shingles, herpesviruses are an increasing global concern. Differentiation and activation of pDCs via sensing of viral double-stranded RNA provides an essential function in the containment of herpesvirus infections by secreting cytokines and chemokines to induce other aspects of antiviral immunity. Thus it is important to better understand how manipulation of pDC activity can improve therapeutic approaches for inhibiting or containing such persistent viruses. Here we review our current understanding on immunopathogenesis delineated by studies using multiple clinical isolates alongside genetic manipulations in vitro, providing insights into potential strategies for treating these widespread viral afflictions with improved efficacy.",1
Segmented Helical Structure of the Neck Region of the Glycan-Binding Receptor DC-SIGNR,"Carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs) in the glycan-binding receptors DC-SIGN (dendritic-cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule 1-grabbing nonintegrin; CD209) and DC-SIGNR (DC-SIGN-related receptor, also known as L-SIGN and variously designated CD209L and CD299) are projected from the membrane surface by extended neck domains containing multiple repeats of a largely conserved 23-amino-acid sequence motif. Crystals of a fragment of the neck domain of DC-SIGNR containing multiple repeats in which each molecule extends through multiple unit cells, such that the observed crystallographic asymmetric unit represents one repeat averaged over six repeats of the protein, have been obtained. The repeats are largely α-helical. Based on the structure and arrangement of the repeats in the crystal, the neck region can be described as a series of four-helix bundles connected by short, non-helical linkers. Combining the structure of the isolated neck domain with a previously determined overlapping structure of the distal end of the neck region with the CRDs attached provides a model of the almost-complete extracellular portion of the receptor. The results are consistent with previous characterization of the extended structure for the isolated neck region and the extracellular domain. The organization of the neck suggests how CRDs may be disposed differently in DC-SIGN compared with DC-SIGNR and in variant forms of DC-SIGNR assembled from polypeptides with different numbers of repeats in the neck domain.",0
Conserved epitopes of influenza A virus inducing protective immunity and their prospects for universal vaccine development,"Influenza A viruses belong to the best studied viruses, however no effective prevention against influenza infection has been developed. The emerging of still new escape variants of influenza A viruses causing epidemics and periodic worldwide pandemics represents a threat for human population. Therefore, current, hot task of influenza virus research is to look for a way how to get us closer to a universal vaccine. Combination of chosen conserved antigens inducing cross-protective antibody response with epitopes activating also cross-protective cytotoxic T-cells would offer an attractive strategy for improving protection against drift variants of seasonal influenza viruses and reduces the impact of future pandemic strains. Antigenically conserved fusion-active subunit of hemagglutinin (HA2 gp) and ectodomain of matrix protein 2 (eM2) are promising candidates for preparation of broadly protective HA2- or eM2-based vaccine that may aid in pandemic preparedness. Overall protective effect could be achieved by contribution of epitopes recognized by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTL) that have been studied extensively to reach much broader control of influenza infection. In this review we present the state-of-art in this field. We describe known adaptive immune mechanisms mediated by influenza specific B- and T-cells involved in the anti-influenza immune defense together with the contribution of innate immunity. We discuss the mechanisms of neutralization of influenza infection mediated by antibodies, the role of CTL in viral elimination and new approaches to develop epitope based vaccine inducing cross-protective influenza virus-specific immune response.",0
Large-scale evolutionary surveillance of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus using resequencing arrays,"In April 2009, a new influenza A (H1N1 2009) virus emerged that rapidly spread around the world. While current variants of this virus have caused widespread disease, particularly in vulnerable groups, there remains the possibility that future variants may cause increased virulence, drug resistance or vaccine escape. Early detection of these virus variants may offer the chance for increased containment and potentially prevention of the virus spread. We have developed and field-tested a resequencing kit that is capable of interrogating all eight segments of the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) virus genome and its variants, with added focus on critical regions such as drug-binding sites, structural components and mutation hotspots. The accompanying base-calling software (EvolSTAR) introduces novel methods that utilize neighbourhood hybridization intensity profiles and substitution bias of probes on the microarray for mutation confirmation and recovery of ambiguous base queries. Our results demonstrate that EvolSTAR is highly accurate and has a much improved call rate. The high throughput and short turn-around time from sample to sequence and analysis results (30 h for 24 samples) makes this kit an efficient large-scale evolutionary biosurveillance tool.",0
Transcript-level annotation of Affymetrix probesets improves the interpretation of gene expression data,"BACKGROUND: The wide use of Affymetrix microarray in broadened fields of biological research has made the probeset annotation an important issue. Standard Affymetrix probeset annotation is at gene level, i.e. a probeset is precisely linked to a gene, and probeset intensity is interpreted as gene expression. The increased knowledge that one gene may have multiple transcript variants clearly brings up the necessity of updating this gene-level annotation to a refined transcript-level. RESULTS: Through performing rigorous alignments of the Affymetrix probe sequences against a comprehensive pool of currently available transcript sequences, and further linking the probesets to the International Protein Index, we generated transcript-level or protein-level annotation tables for two popular Affymetrix expression arrays, Mouse Genome 430A 2.0 Array and Human Genome U133A Array. Application of our new annotations in re-examining existing expression data sets shows increased expression consistency among synonymous probesets and strengthened expression correlation between interacting proteins. CONCLUSION: By refining the standard Affymetrix annotation of microarray probesets from the gene level to the transcript level and protein level, one can achieve a more reliable interpretation of their experimental data, which may lead to discovery of more profound regulatory mechanism.",0
An intermolecular RNA triplex provides insight into structural determinants for the pseudoknot stimulator of −1 ribosomal frameshifting,"An efficient −1 programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) signal requires an RNA slippery sequence and a downstream RNA stimulator, and the hairpin-type pseudoknot is the most common stimulator. However, a pseudoknot is not sufficient to promote −1 PRF. hTPK-DU177, a pseudoknot derived from human telomerase RNA, shares structural similarities with several −1 PRF pseudoknots and is used to dissect the roles of distinct structural features in the stimulator of −1 PRF. Structure-based mutagenesis on hTPK-DU177 reveals that the −1 PRF efficiency of this stimulator can be modulated by sequential removal of base–triple interactions surrounding the helical junction. Further analysis of the junction-flanking base triples indicates that specific stem–loop interactions and their relative positions to the helical junction play crucial roles for the −1 PRF activity of this pseudoknot. Intriguingly, a bimolecular pseudoknot approach based on hTPK-DU177 reveals that continuing triplex structure spanning the helical junction, lacking one of the loop-closure features embedded in pseudoknot topology, can stimulate −1 PRF. Therefore, the triplex structure is an essential determinant for the DU177 pseudoknot to stimulate −1 PRF. Furthermore, it suggests that −1 PRF, induced by an in-trans RNA via specific base–triple interactions with messenger RNAs, can be a plausible regulatory function for non-coding RNAs.",0
Quantitative analysis of Glycyrrhizic acid from a polyherbal preparation using liquid chromatographic technique,"

This paper presents a quantitative analysis of Glycyrrhizic Acid (GA) within an Ayurvedic polyherbal preparation using Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). With increasing demand for herbal remedies, safety issues involving the quality and potency of these products have arisen. Quality control testing is needed to verify potency in conjunction with regulatory standards. The focus of this study was to accurately determine GA content within one particular polyherbal formulation which contains five herbs used for reducing inflammation and supporting gastrointestinal health through long history use in traditional Indian medicine. LC-MS/ MS was utilized as the analytical technique after optimizing mobile phases that provided adequate separation and resolution as well as ensuring sensitivity, precision, accuracy and specificity at trace concentrations levels. Several real samples were further analyzed it showed good agreement with values reported on label claims indicating expected validated results emphasizing development of reliable test method to ascertain active constituent presence or absence from any natural product is necessary before recommending its therapeutic efficacy and safety profile amid patient population especially vulnerable adults and children. Our finding suggests potential application for regular monitoring active ingredients present or absent from finished dosage formulae complying standard guidelines issued by regulatory agencies worldwide regarding adulteration survey indexing henceforth correct dosing assurance should be emphasized among consumers in emerging markets like India considering marketing trends upcoming 2021 years",1
Mannose-Binding Lectin Contributes to Deleterious Inflammatory Response in Pandemic H1N1 and Avian H9N2 Infection,"

This study presents an in-depth exploration of the role of mannose-binding lectin (MBL) in the deleterious inflammatory response caused by both pandemic H1N1 and avian H9N2 infection. MBL, a member of the innate immune system's soluble pattern recognition receptors, has frequently been implicated in viral infections. Here we report that MBL contributes to inflammasome activation following these two virus strains' replication due to its involvement in recognizing glycoproteins on infected cell membranes that result in NF-κB dependent proinflammatory cytokines. Through an array of experiments utilizing cellular models across species as well as clinical samples from humans and animals, our investigators uncovered and confirmed a positive association between MBL levels and proinflammatory responses associated with untreated populations of this disease. This research offers important insights into how MBL may be involved in exacerbating influenza infections and provides direction for further investigation on its role within different viral diseases.",1
The Impact of Contact Tracing in Clustered Populations,"The tracing of potentially infectious contacts has become an important part of the control strategy for many infectious diseases, from early cases of novel infections to endemic sexually transmitted infections. Here, we make use of mathematical models to consider the case of partner notification for sexually transmitted infection, however these models are sufficiently simple to allow more general conclusions to be drawn. We show that, when contact network structure is considered in addition to contact tracing, standard “mass action” models are generally inadequate. To consider the impact of mutual contacts (specifically clustering) we develop an improvement to existing pairwise network models, which we use to demonstrate that ceteris paribus, clustering improves the efficacy of contact tracing for a large region of parameter space. This result is sometimes reversed, however, for the case of highly effective contact tracing. We also develop stochastic simulations for comparison, using simple re-wiring methods that allow the generation of appropriate comparator networks. In this way we contribute to the general theory of network-based interventions against infectious disease.",0
Activity based protein profiling to detect serine hydrolase alterations in virus infected cells,"

This paper presents a novel method for the detection of alterations in serine hydrolases caused by viral infections. Activity based protein profiling (ABPP) was used to analyse and differentiate between viral infected and uninfected cells in order to identify those enzymes regulated by virus infection. The results show that ABPP is advantageous over standard assays as it can detect differential activity upon certain substrates even at minute amounts of enzyme present within the host cell, thus allowing improved identification of altered enzyme activities induced by viral infection. This research has implications for advancing our knowledge on biochemical mechanisms driving virulence and could ultimately help develop targeted therapeutic interventions against viruses which rely on enzymatic changes for their pathogenicity.",1
"Remission of Invasive, Cancer Stem-Like Glioblastoma Xenografts Using Lentiviral Vector-Mediated Suicide Gene Therapy","BACKGROUND: Glioblastoma is the most frequent and most malignant primary brain tumor with a poor prognosis. The translation of therapeutic strategies for glioblastoma from the experimental phase into the clinic has been limited by insufficient animal models, which lack important features of human tumors. Lentiviral gene therapy is an attractive therapeutic option for human glioblastoma, which we validated in a clinically relevant animal model. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used a rodent xenograft model that recapitulates the invasive and angiogenic features of human glioblastoma to analyze the transduction pattern and therapeutic efficacy of lentiviral pseudotyped vectors. Both, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus glycoprotein (LCMV-GP) and vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSV-G) pseudotyped lentiviral vectors very efficiently transduced human glioblastoma cells in vitro and in vivo. In contrast, pseudotyped gammaretroviral vectors, similar to those evaluated for clinical therapy of glioblastoma, showed inefficient gene transfer in vitro and in vivo. Both pseudotyped lentiviral vectors transduced cancer stem-like cells characterized by their CD133-, nestin- and SOX2-expression, the ability to form spheroids in neural stem cell medium and to express astrocytic and neuronal differentiation markers under serum conditions. In a therapeutic approach using the suicide gene herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-1-tk) fused to eGFP, both lentiviral vectors mediated a complete remission of solid tumors as seen on MRI resulting in a highly significant survival benefit (p<0.001) compared to control groups. In all recurrent tumors, surviving eGFP-positive tumor cells were found, advocating prodrug application for several cycles to even enhance and prolong the therapeutic effect. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: In conclusion, lentiviral pseudotyped vectors are promising candidates for gene therapy of glioma in patients. The inefficient gene delivery by gammaretroviral vectors is in line with the results obtained in clinical therapy for GBM and thus confirms the high reproducibility of the invasive glioma animal model for translational research.",0
Vaccinia virus infection disrupts microtubule organization and centrosome function,"We examined the role of the microtubule cytoskeleton during vaccinia virus infection. We found that newly assembled virus particles accumulate in the vicinity of the microtubule-organizing centre in a microtubule- and dynein–dynactin complex-dependent fashion. Microtubules are required for efficient intracellular mature virus (IMV) formation and are essential for intracellular enveloped virus (IEV) assembly. As infection proceeds, the microtubule cytoskeleton becomes dramatically reorganized in a fashion reminiscent of overexpression of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs). Consistent with this, we report that the vaccinia proteins A10L and L4R have MAP-like properties and mediate direct binding of viral cores to microtubules in vitro. In addition, vaccinia infection also results in severe reduction of proteins at the centrosome and loss of centrosomal microtubule nucleation efficiency. This represents the first example of viral-induced disruption of centrosome function. Further studies with vaccinia will provide insights into the role of microtubules during viral pathogenesis and regulation of centrosome function.",0
Proteomics Analysis of the Nucleolus in Adenovirus-infected Cells,"Adenoviruses replicate primarily in the host cell nucleus, and it is well established that adenovirus infection affects the structure and function of host cell nucleoli in addition to coding for a number of nucleolar targeted viral proteins. Here we used unbiased proteomics methods, including high throughput mass spectrometry coupled with stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) and traditional two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, to identify quantitative changes in the protein composition of the nucleolus during adenovirus infection. Two-dimensional gel analysis revealed changes in six proteins. By contrast, SILAC-based approaches identified 351 proteins with 24 proteins showing at least a 2-fold change after infection. Of those, four were previously reported to have aberrant localization and/or functional relevance during adenovirus infection. In total, 15 proteins identified as changing in amount by proteomics methods were examined in infected cells using confocal microscopy. Eleven of these proteins showed altered patterns of localization in adenovirus-infected cells. Comparing our data with the effects of actinomycin D on the nucleolar proteome revealed that adenovirus infection apparently specifically targets a relatively small subset of nucleolar antigens at the time point examined.",0
Influenza A/H1N1 septic shock in a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus. A case report,"

This case report presents a unique observation of an adult patient diagnosed with systemic lupus erythematosus who developed septic shock following an influenza A/H1N1 infection. The clinical picture, laboratory tests, and further treatment options are assessed in order to create further insight on the potential life threatening effect of such viruses for patients with autoimmune diseases. This serves as a warning for medical professionals dealing with high risk patients as well as demonstrating the need to consider more detailed immunological profiles when diagnosis and treatment decisions are made.",1
"Virology Experts in the Boundary Zone Between Science, Policy and the Public: A Biographical Analysis","This article aims to open up the biographical black box of three experts working in the boundary zone between science, policy and public debate. A biographical-narrative approach is used to analyse the roles played by the virologists Albert Osterhaus, Roel Coutinho and Jaap Goudsmit in policy and public debate. These figures were among the few leading virologists visibly active in the Netherlands during the revival of infectious diseases in the 1980s. Osterhaus and Coutinho in particular are still the key figures today, as demonstrated during the outbreak of novel influenza A (H1N1). This article studies the various political and communicative challenges and dilemmas encountered by these three virologists, and discusses the way in which, strategically or not, they handled those challenges and dilemmas during the various stages of the field’s recent history. Important in this respect is their pursuit of a public role that is both effective and credible. We will conclude with a reflection on the H1N1 pandemic, and the historical and biographical ties between emerging governance arrangements and the experts involved in the development of such arrangements.",0
"Optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life during pregnancy across three continents: a matched cohort study in China, Ghana, and the United States","BACKGROUND: Little is known about how optimism/pessimism and health-related quality of life compare across cultures. METHODS: Three samples of pregnant women in their final trimester were recruited from China, Ghana, and the United States (U.S.). Participants completed a survey that included the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R, an optimism/pessimism measure), the Short Form 12 (SF-12, a quality of life measure), and questions addressing health and demographic factors. A three-country set was created for analysis by matching women on age, gestational age at enrollment, and number of previous pregnancies. Anovas with post-hoc pairwise comparisons were used to compare results across the cohorts. Multivariate regression analysis was used to create a model to identify those variables most strongly associated with optimism/pessimism. RESULTS: LOT-R scores varied significantly across cultures in these samples, with Ghanaian pregnant women being the most optimistic and least pessimistic and Chinese pregnant women being the least optimistic overall and the least pessimistic in subscale analysis. Four key variables predicted approximately 20% of the variance in overall optimism scores: country of origin (p = .006), working for money (p = .05); level of education (p = .002), and ever being treated for emotional issues with medication (p < .001). Quality of life scores also varied by country in these samples, with the most pronounced difference occurring in the vitality measure. U.S. pregnant women reported far lower vitality scores than both Chinese and Ghanaian pregnant women in our sample. CONCLUSION: This research raises important questions regarding what it is about country of origin that so strongly influences optimism/pessimism among pregnant women. Further research is warranted exploring underlying conceptualization of optimism/pessimism and health related quality of life across countries.",0
The geosimulation of West Nile virus propagation: a multi-agent and climate sensitive tool for risk management in public health,"BACKGROUND: Since 1999, the expansion of the West Nile virus (WNV) epizooty has led public health authorities to build and operate surveillance systems in North America. These systems are very useful to collect data, but cannot be used to forecast the probable spread of the virus in coming years. Such forecasts, if proven reliable, would permit preventive measures to be put into place at the appropriate level of expected risk and at the appropriate time. It is within this context that the Multi-Agent GeoSimulation approach has been selected to develop a system that simulates the interactions of populations of mosquitoes and birds over space and time in relation to the spread and transmission of WNV. This simulation takes place in a virtual mapping environment representing a large administrative territory (e.g. province, state) and carried out under various climate scenarios in order to simulate the effects of vector control measures such as larviciding at scales of 1/20 000 or smaller. RESULTS: After setting some hypotheses, a conceptual model and system architecture were developed to describe the population dynamics and interactions of mosquitoes (genus Culex) and American crows, which were chosen as the main actors in the simulation. Based on a mathematical compartment model used to simulate the population dynamics, an operational prototype was developed for the Southern part of Quebec (Canada). The system allows users to modify the parameters of the model, to select various climate and larviciding scenarios, to visualize on a digital map the progression (on a weekly or daily basis) of the infection in and around the crows' roosts and to generate graphs showing the evolution of the populations. The basic units for visualisation are municipalities. CONCLUSION: In all likelihood this system might be used to support short term decision-making related to WNV vector control measures, including the use of larvicides, according to climatic scenarios. Once fully calibrated in several real-life contexts, this promising approach opens the door to the study and management of other zoonotic diseases such as Lyme disease.",0
The changing phenotype of microglia from homeostasis to disease,"

This article is a scientific study of the changing phenotype of microglia, which play essential roles in the homeostasis of the brain tissue. Many recent studies have investigated how dramatic shifts in their activities and morphology lead to pathological states such as neuroinflammation; however, much remains unknown about these dynamics. This paper focuses on characterizing changes to the cellular architecture and functionalities of microglia under different physiological conditions and examines its various implications for neuroscience research. The results from this study will provide increased insight into disease-specific features associated with altered morphological structure and function from healthy populations, thereby aiding in designing more effective therapeutic interventions that target step-wise activation or inhibition of molecular pathways.",1
Epidemiology is ecosystem science,"

Epidemiology is highly esteemed as the science of epidemics, yet it rarely receives recognition for its intricate fusion between medical and environmental sciences. 'Epidemiology is Ecosystem Science' suggests that such studies in fact offer indispensable insights into global ecosystems, providing critical guidance for public health responses to emerging threats from infectious diseases. A comprehensive review embracing this transdisciplinary approach aims to define the scope and breadth of epidemiological investigations in ecosystem health contexts, thereby demonstrating its essential role within contemporary scientific research.",1
"Serious Invasive Saffold Virus Infections in Children, 2009","

This paper presents an analysis of serious invasive saffold virus infections in children aged 0-14 during the year 2009. Using National Notifiable Disease Surveillance Cards data collected by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we studied the occurrence, risk factors and epidemiological characteristics of these infections throughout this population group. We found that infection rates peaked in summer months when temperatures are highest with greater spread to rural communities compared to urban areas; what’s more, cases were seen most frequently among young infants up through 5 years old. Our research will inform policy makers on prevention strategies while also assisting healthcare providers develop better diagnostic tools as well as treatments aimed at reducing childhood morbidity due to Saffold Virus Infections.",1
A Single Native Ganglioside GM(1)-Binding Site Is Sufficient for Cholera Toxin To Bind to Cells and Complete the Intoxication Pathway,"

This paper explores the role of gangliosides in Cholera toxin (CT) binding to mammalian cells. Recent findings suggest that one native GM(1)-binding site on CT is sufficient for cell-membrane attachment and subsequent intoxication pathway completion. To determine this, a variety of techniques was employed including NMR spectroscopy, surface plasmon resonance (SPR), glycolipid competition assays as well as cellular studies using several CHO cell lines presenting different levels of GM(1). Collectively, available evidence indicates that a single native GM(1)-binding site on CT enables it to bind strongly enough to initiate the colonization process which leads towards further intoxication stages. These results provide convincing proof for the role of ganglioside receptors in microbial recognition exteriorization events.",1
Implications of copy number variation in people with chromosomal abnormalities: potential for greater variation in copy number state may contribute to variability of phenotype,"Copy number variation is common in the human genome with many regions, overlapping thousands of genes, now known to be deleted or amplified. Aneuploidies and other forms of chromosomal imbalance have a wide range of adverse phenotypes and are a common cause of birth defects resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. “Normal” copy number variants (CNVs) embedded within the regions of chromosome imbalance may affect the clinical outcomes by altering the local copy number of important genes or regulatory regions: this could alleviate or exacerbate certain phenotypes. In this way CNVs may contribute to the clinical variability seen in many disorders caused by chromosomal abnormalities, such as the congenital heart defects (CHD) seen in ~40% of Down’s syndrome (DS) patients. Investigation of CNVs may therefore help to pinpoint critical genes or regulatory elements, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions, also shedding light on the aetiology of such phenotypes in people without major chromosome imbalances, and ultimately leading to their improved detection and treatment.",0
The Final Size of an Epidemic and Its Relation to the Basic Reproduction Number,"

This paper examines the role of the Basic Reproduction Number (R0) in determining the final size of an epidemic. Through a combination of analytical models, numerical simulations, and real-world experiments, this research investigates how R0 affects both early growth and late saturation phases of an epidemic as well as what impact interventions might have on limiting its final magnitude. The subsequent analysis will provide insights into how epidemics propagate and build upon our current understanding of R0’s influencing factors. Thus, it could control infectious diseases by allowing prediction of suitable intervention strategies ahead in time for better public health management.",1
NKG2D contributes to efficient clearance of picornavirus from the acutely infected murine brain,"

This paper investigates the impact of NKG2D-mediated immunosurveillance during acute picornavirus infection in murine brain. The relevance of this study is highlighted by its potential to uncover further clinical insights into the clearance and control mechanism of viral diseases, as well as their progression towards chronic illness and recurrence after remission. Our results indicate that NKG2D involves a protective role for efficient expulsion of picornaviruses from cell tissue upon initial attack. This research provides detailed evidence regarding differential regulations throughout specific regions within the hosts’ central nervous system (CNS) affected by these positive regulators, acting against disease symptoms and emergence of secondary infections caused by microbial agents in acutely infected mice brains.",1
Measuring healthcare preparedness: an all-hazards approach,"

This study investigates healthcare organizations' preparedness for a range of disasters and health-related crises. It reports on the development, validation and application of a validated assessment tool to evaluate hospital preparedness for different types of crises that may affect their communities. The authors have used an ""all hazards"" approach which aims at evaluating healthcare organizations' ability to respond effectively in any type of event, whether natural or manmade in origin. Through extensive data collection from over 100 hospitals across 5 countries, key aspects such as leadership readiness and organizational resources were evaluated based on best practice evidence-based guidelines. Findings provide insight into current practices among major international healthcare settings and suggest improvements in critical areas related to patient outcomes following different disaster situations.",1
Is the risk of multiple sclerosis related to the ‘biography’ of the immune system?,"Multiple sclerosis (MS) with onset in childhood offers a unique opportunity to study the infectious background of this disease but the immune reactions against infectious agents in such children have only recently been investigated. These and other epidemiological studies strongly implicate involvement of one or more infectious agents in the aetiology of MS, with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) being the prime candidate. Rather than being the actual cause of MS, it is more probable that these agents are involved in the development of immunoregulatory pathways. These pathways, if disturbed by hygiene-related factors including an altered sequence of infections, may generate and maintain a deficit within the immunological network that facilitates, to particular early events in the development of MS, preceding the onset of MS disease by years or a decade. A framework that can serve as a guide for further epidemiological, immunologic and molecular biologic investigations is formulated. This approach may shed light on the complex natural history of MS and may lead to rational preventive and therapeutic strategies. It is possible that, in the future, MS could be prevented by vaccination against EBV in early childhood; the framework is of relevance to the design of an appropriate type of vaccine.",0
Amiodarone Exposure During Modest Inflammation Induces Idiosyncrasy-like Liver Injury in Rats: Role of Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha,"

This study investigates how amiodarone exposure, a pharmaceutical used to treat arrhythmias and other cardiac issues, can lead to the progression of intrahepatic cholestasis and liver injury in rats during modest inflammation. The authors seek to elucidate the role Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNFα) plays on this phenomenon to provide novel insight into amiodarone’s toxicity. In light of the rise in liver injuries associated with human treatment using this drug, understanding the pathobiological consequences is crucial for clinical practice. 
This study utilized an animal model given amiodarone combined with ovalbumin-induced repeated syngeneic screenings and lipopolysaccharide immunization for comparison between rat groups subjected only to infection versus those exposed to both exposures. Histopathologic analyses including steatosis scoring demonstrated more severe inflammation intensity, mainly due to upregulation of TNFα caused by amiodarone involvement which consequently led to elevated serum alanine transaminase activities as well as decreased serum bile acid concentrations synergistically promoting intrahepatic cholestasis analogous with idiosyncrasy-like syndrome observed in humans undergoing similar treatments. 
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that intravenous administration of small doses of amiodarone exacerbates objective parameters associated with adverse events upon treating moderate inflammation conditions.(248 words)",1
Targeting Herpetic Keratitis by Gene Therapy,"

This paper presents an comprehensive investigation into the effects of gene therapy on Herpetic Keratitis, with a focus on its potential in reducing the severity and duration of the infection. Recent studies have suggested that recombinant gene therapy could offer enhanced clinical protection over antiviral medication by increasing target cells' ability to develop stronger antiviral defences. This study will investigate whether such treatment can effectively prevent or ameliorate attenuated herpetic keratitis symptoms. Data was collected through interviews with 10 participants who had recently been subjected to a single course of gene therapy as well as from detailed analyses of their medical records and blood samples. Results showed a significant reduction in inflammation and tissue damage following gene-therapy compared to individuals not treated using this method, suggesting it is highly effective for controlling herpetic virus activity. These data further bolster claims that gene-therapy make be a viable option for treating this debilitating condition when conventional therapies fail.",1
Reducing mortality in sepsis: new directions," 

This paper will explore the development of treatment strategies for sepsis and how they can be used to reduce mortality rates. Sepsis is a major cause of death worldwide, with as many as 6 million people per year having died from it in 2019 alone, according to World Health Organization estimates. Recently developed targeted treatments such as antibiotics have been useful in treating milder forms of sepsis, while more intensive approaches such as immunotherapy may help treat cases where the disease has become more serious or life-threatening. For this paper we will analyse multiple different types of therapeutic options and see which ones are the most effective when it comes to reducing overall mortality associated with sepsis. We aim to identify key factors that influence outcome and demonstrate ways on how these strategies can be better directed at improving patient care by providing detailed explanations on their effectiveness and possible side effects. The results obtained from this could inform policy decisions regarding funding allocation and incentivize further research into new areas in order to improve global health outcomes related to this deadly condition.",1
Use of controlled low dose gamma irradiation to sterilize allograft tendons for ACL reconstruction: biomechanical and clinical perspective,"

We investigate its potential impact on graft material properties and patient post-operative recovery outcomes, aiming to provide evidence-based guidance for clinicians managing such cases.",1
A sensitive array-based assay for identifying multiple TMPRSS2:ERG fusion gene variants,"Studies of gene fusions in solid tumors are not as extensive as in hematological malignancies due to several technical and analytical problems associated with tumor heterogeneity. Nevertheless, there is a growing interest in the role of fusion genes in common epithelial tumors after the discovery of recurrent TMPRSS2:ETS fusions in prostate cancer. Among all of the reported fusion partners in the ETS gene family, TMPRSS2:ERG is the most prevalent one. Here, we present a simple and sensitive microarray-based assay that is able to simultaneously determine multiple fusion variants with a single RT–PCR in impure RNA specimens. The assay detected TMPRSS2:ERG fusion transcripts with a detection sensitivity of <10 cells in the presence of more than 3000 times excess normal RNA, and in primary prostate tumors having no >1% of cancer cells. The ability to detect multiple transcript variants in a single assay is critically dependent on both the primer and probe designs. The assay should facilitate clinical and basic studies for fusion gene screening in clinical specimens, as it can be readily adapted to include multiple gene loci.",0
A Novel Vaccine Using Nanoparticle Platform to Present Immunogenic M2e against Avian Influenza Infection,"

This article presents a novel vaccine platform using nanoparticles to present immunogenic M2e against avian influenza infection. Avian Influenza, widely known as bird flu, is an infectious disease caused by the H5N1 virus that has had a major global impact in recent years. As the mortality rate associated with this form of influenza is dangerously high and traditional vaccines for avian influenza are deemed insufficient at achieving the necessary immunogenicity levels, the development of a robust and effective vaccine to reduce mortality rates among poultry and other birds has been identified as a priority in public health circles. To address this issue, we have developed a new platform composed of engineered nanoparticles coupled with synthetic glycopeptide-based antigens derived from the conserved region of matrix protein 2 ectodomain (M2e) antigenic sites located within H5N1 viral strains allowing us to allocate immunogenic copies at precise locations on each particle’s surface. Our results demonstrate its effectiveness compared to current vaccines both in vitro and after vaccination trials conducted in poultry species offering potential for reduction of incidences among domestic poultry flocks around world providing an alternative solution for combatting bird flu infections thus contributing towards global food security.",1
Increased Urinary Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 in Renal Transplant Patients with Diabetes,"

The title of this article is ""Increased Urinary Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 in Renal Transplant Patients with Diabetes"". This manuscript examines the significance of urinary angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) levels in individuals who have undergone renal transplantation and are suffering from diabetes. In recent years, studies have found that increased ACE2 expression has a potential therapeutic function in preventing diabetic nephropathy, although further research is needed to clarify any connection between its presence and disease progression. To better assess this possible link, we performed a meta-analysis to investigate differences between basal urinary ACE2 levels among renal transplant recipients with or without diabetes. Using modern medical exam techniques such as urine culture and Western Blotting analysis on patient samples collected at multiple centers over 6 months period; our findings provide support that increased ACE2 concentrations in the urines of patients with diabetes after undergoing kidney transplant may signify an improved long-term prognosis for protection against developing diabetic nephropathy. Our study adds novel insights into various aspects regarding the role of ACE2 in relevance to chronic kidney diseases amongst seeking new treatments for diabetic chronic conditions through better understanding their complex pathophysiological mechanism which could be applicable beyond renal transplants too.",1
Avipoxviruses: infection biology and their use as vaccine vectors,"Avipoxviruses (APVs) belong to the Chordopoxvirinae subfamily of the Poxviridae family. APVs are distributed worldwide and cause disease in domestic, pet and wild birds of many species. APVs are transmitted by aerosols and biting insects, particularly mosquitoes and arthropods and are usually named after the bird species from which they were originally isolated. The virus species Fowlpox virus (FWPV) causes disease in poultry and associated mortality is usually low, but in flocks under stress (other diseases, high production) mortality can reach up to 50%. APVs are also major players in viral vaccine vector development for diseases in human and veterinary medicine. Abortive infection in mammalian cells (no production of progeny viruses) and their ability to accommodate multiple gene inserts are some of the characteristics that make APVs promising vaccine vectors. Although abortive infection in mammalian cells conceivably represents a major vaccine bio-safety advantage, molecular mechanisms restricting APVs to certain hosts are not yet fully understood. This review summarizes the current knowledge relating to APVs, including classification, morphogenesis, host-virus interactions, diagnostics and disease, and also highlights the use of APVs as recombinant vaccine vectors.",0
High Throughput Screening for Small Molecule Enhancers of the Interferon Signaling Pathway to Drive Next-Generation Antiviral Drug Discovery,"

High Throughput Screening for Small Molecule Enhancers of the Interferon Signaling Pathway to Drive Next-Generation Antiviral Drug Discovery 

Viruses are continuously evolving and become increasingly resistant to conventional antivirals. Therefore, there is an urgent need for new treatments that can better target viral infections and combat drug resistance. Interferons (IFNs) are central antimicrobial cytokines that play a major role in instigating innate immunity; thus, modulators of IFN signaling could provide novel therapeutics for next generation virus inhibition. Herein, we describe a high throughput screening assay utilized to identify small molcule enhancers of the IFN cascade as potential therapeutic leads against rapidly emerging viruses. Our assay utilizes HeLa cells, engineered with luciferase expression controlled by two interferon-inducible promoters which display increased luminescence when interacting with stimulatory molecules on incubation with polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C). The development of a high throughput library assaying system has enabled us to rapidly identify compounds capable of augmenting basal IFN activity and further provide guidance towards structure activity relationships between natural products/derivatives identified herein and their ability as enhancers predisposing activation by intracellular ligands; consequently demonstrating characteristics suitable for synergistic combinations amongst existing and newly developed therapies. Each compound exhibiting enhanced bioactivity in the presence or absence of poly I:C was synthesized surrounding densely populated halogen replacements among other variably derivatives using optimized methods widely reported within our laboratory framework providing an invaluable foundation from which pharmaceutical scientists may analyze mechanistic approaches relevant to isolating the most competent molecules involved in regulating this important pathway.",1
A Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Replicon-Based Bioassay for the Rapid and Sensitive Determination of Multi-Species Type I Interferon,"

This study presents a novel cell-based bioassay that utilizes non-recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus replicon (rVSV) as vector system to detect multi-species type I interferon concentration. The rVSV conserves replication competent and highly virulent G glycoprotein substitution which increases the sensitivity of detection. Resulting from optimized HA screening experiments, we identified four species of neutralizing antibodies with specific activity against circulating strains of the virus indicating their suitability for functional assays. Furthermore, an analytical model was developed in order to simultaneously measure IFN induction by multiple stimuli using this reconstituted rVSV vector system and applicable for different sample types collected over time ranging from human/animal serum through tissue homogenates as well as various culture mediums. This method builds on current methods of IFN quantification providing greater accuracy, reduced runtime and decreased cost allowing a high throughput determination suitable for research laboratories or clinical facilities dealing with infections caused by the target viruses and bacteria which employs type I interferons.",1
Electrochemical Molecular Analysis Without Nucleic Acid Amplification,"Electrochemical biosensors have revolutionized glucose monitoring but have not yet fulfilled their promise of a low cost, direct detection replacement for genetic amplification tests such as PCR [K. Kerman, M. Kobayashi, E. Tamiya, Recent trends in electro-chemical DNA biosensor technology, Meas. Sci. Technol. 15 (2004) R1-R11; A. Chaubey, B.D. Malhotra, Mediated biosensors. Biosens. Bioelectron. 17 (6-7) (2002) 441-456]. It has been anticipated that the integration of nanoscale chemical structures such as self-assembled monolayers with electrochemical biosensors would increase sensitivity by decreasing inherent system noise. We have designed a novel biosensing approach incorporating such integration and achieved rapid, ultra-low concentration sensitivities without target amplification. Raw samples are mixed with lysis buffer to allow hybridization of nucleic acid targets with anchor and signal probes before immobilizing a signaling enzyme proximate to the biosensor surface. A bias potential is subsequently applied and the secondary byproduct of a cyclic peroxidase reaction measured. Further studies have demonstrated the application of our approach in protein, clinical chemistry, and ionic assays.",0
"Ketamine inhibits tumor necrosis factor secretion by RAW264.7 murine macrophages stimulated with antibiotic-exposed strains of community-associated, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus","BACKGROUND: Infections caused by community-associated strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) are associated with a marked and prolonged host inflammatory response. In a sepsis simulation model, we tested whether the anesthetic ketamine inhibits the macrophage TNF response to antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA bacteria via its antagonism of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. RAW264.7 cells were stimulated for 18 hrs with 10(5 )to 10(7 )CFU/mL inocula of either of two prototypical CA-MRSA isolates, USA300 strain LAC and USA400 strain MW2, in the presence of either vancomycin or daptomycin. One hour before bacterial stimulation, ketamine was added with or without MK-801 (dizocilpine, a chemically unrelated non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), APV (D-2-amino-5-phosphono-valerate, a competitive NMDA receptor antagonist), NMDA, or combinations of these agents. Supernatants were collected and assayed for TNF concentration by ELISA. RESULTS: RAW264.7 cells exposed to either LAC or MW2 in the presence of daptomycin secreted less TNF than in the presence of vancomycin. The addition of ketamine inhibited macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the CA-MRSA isolates (LAC, MW2) in the presence of either antibiotic. The NMDA inhibitors, MK-801 and APV, also suppressed macrophage TNF secretion after stimulation with either of the antibiotic-exposed CA-MRSA isolates, and the effect was not additive or synergistic with ketamine. The addition of NMDA substrate augmented TNF secretion in response to the CA-MRSA bacteria, and the addition of APV suppressed the effect of NMDA in a dose-dependent fashion. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine inhibits TNF secretion by MRSA-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages and the mechanism likely involves NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings may have therapeutic significance in MRSA sepsis.",0
Current Status of the Immunomodulation and Immunomediated Therapeutic Strategies for Multiple Sclerosis,"

This paper presents an overview of the current status of immunomodulatory and immunomediated therapeutic strategies for treating Multiple Sclerosis (MS). An in-depth review is provided on the physiological principles and mechanisms underlying cognitive, physical, sensory and neurobehavioral changes resulting from dysregulation of the immune system. The complex network of interactions between host immunity, inflammation, axonal damage and remyelination are explored. Furthermore, current trends in research to develop novel classes of drugs targeting myeloid cells as well as reprogramming lymphocyte's activity through modulation of signalling pathways is evaluated. Recent progress made in optimizing these new therapies is critically discussed with a focus on safety parameters such as long term effects and possible side effects due to prolonged use. Emerging treatment regimens designed to target lifestyle related traits shared by individuals living with MS are also addressed along with potential future directions for combatting this disabling condition.",1
Infant Pertussis and Household Transmission in Korea,"

Infant Pertussis and Household Transmission in Korea: Examining Risk Factors for Under-Vaccinated Populations
The risk of pertussis transmission among under-vaccinated populations is a significant public health concern worldwide. In particular, infants are considered especially vulnerable to infection due to limited access to vaccination opportunities during the first year of life. To better understand risks posed by household transmission of pertussis in an unvaccinated population context, this study assessed infant household contact exposure against laboratory-confirmed cases from 532 culturally distinct samples within South Korea. Data was gathered over a one-year period and analyzed using descriptive epidemiological methods and chi-squared testing/logistic regression modelling to identify risk factors associated with a positive diagnosis. Results indicated there were significantly higher odds of confirmed infections when households reported 2 or more children present per household compared to those homes with fewer inhabitants (OR = 1.436). These results suggest that non-immunized infants living under crowded conditions may be at greater risk than previously thought which has important implications beyond vaccinations alone as both social behavior and preventative measures will need special attention in future approaches towards positive healthcare outcomes throughout South Korea",1
IFN-γ Signaling to Astrocytes Protects from Autoimmune Mediated Neurological Disability,"

This article presents novel findings on the role of IFN-γ signaling to astrocytes in protection from autoimmune mediated neurological disability. The evidence presented is based on a multidisciplinary approach combining elements of immunology, neuroscience, and inflammation biology within a cell culture system model developed by our laboratory. Results demonstrate that an IFN-γ activated astrocyte phenotype consistently modulates T cell responses when compared to untreated cultures and subsequent effects on autoimmunity were also observed. This study advances understanding of the complex regulatory roles exerted through cellular interplay that ultimately leads to or prevents protective mechanisms associated with neurological diseases due to their dysregulation during autoimmunity. The results herein provide a significant update needed for better targeting treatment strategies specifically aimed at immune-mediated neurological disorders.",1
Disease ecology and the global emergence of zoonotic pathogens,"The incidence and frequency of epidemic transmission of zoonotic diseases, both known and newly recognized, has increased dramatically in the past 30 years. It is thought that this dramatic disease emergence is primarily the result of the social, demographic, and environmental transformation that has occurred globally since World War II. However, the causal linkages have not been elucidated. Investigating emerging zoonotic pathogens as an ecological phenomenon can provide significant insights as to why some of these pathogens have jumped species and caused major epidemics in humans. A review of concepts and theory from biological ecology and of causal factors in disease emergence previously described suggests a general model of global zoonotic disease emergence. The model links demographic and societal factors to land use and land cover change whose associated ecological factors help explain disease emergence. The scale and magnitude of these changes are more significant than those associated with climate change, the effects of which are largely not yet understood. Unfortunately, the complex character and non-linear behavior of the human-natural systems in which host-pathogen systems are embedded makes specific incidences of disease emergence or epidemics inherently difficult to predict. Employing a complex systems analytical approach, however, may show how a few key ecological variables and system properties, including the adaptive capacity of institutions, explains the emergence of infectious diseases and how an integrated, multi-level approach to zoonotic disease control can reduce risk.",0
Detection and characterization of horizontal transfers in prokaryotes using genomic signature,"Horizontal DNA transfer is an important factor of evolution and participates in biological diversity. Unfortunately, the location and length of horizontal transfers (HTs) are known for very few species. The usage of short oligonucleotides in a sequence (the so-called genomic signature) has been shown to be species-specific even in DNA fragments as short as 1 kb. The genomic signature is therefore proposed as a tool to detect HTs. Since DNA transfers originate from species with a signature different from those of the recipient species, the analysis of local variations of signature along recipient genome may allow for detecting exogenous DNA. The strategy consists in (i) scanning the genome with a sliding window, and calculating the corresponding local signature (ii) evaluating its deviation from the signature of the whole genome and (iii) looking for similar signatures in a database of genomic signatures. A total of 22 prokaryote genomes are analyzed in this way. It has been observed that atypical regions make up ∼6% of each genome on the average. Most of the claimed HTs as well as new ones are detected. The origin of putative DNA transfers is looked for among ∼12 000 species. Donor species are proposed and sometimes strongly suggested, considering similarity of signatures. Among the species studied, Bacillus subtilis, Haemophilus Influenzae and Escherichia coli are investigated by many authors and give the opportunity to perform a thorough comparison of most of the bioinformatics methods used to detect HTs.",0
Global Expression Profiling in Epileptogenesis: Does It Add to the Confusion?,"Since the inception of global gene expression profiling platforms in the mid-1990s, there has been a significant increase in publications of differentially expressed genes in the process of epileptogenesis. In particular for mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, the presence of a latency period between the first manifestation of seizures to chronic epilepsy provides the opportunity for therapeutic interventions at the molecular biology level. Using global expression profiling techniques, approximately 2000 genes have been published demonstrating differential expression in mesial temporal epilepsy. The majority of these changes, however, are specific to laboratory or experimental conditions with only 53 genes demonstrating changes in more than two publications. To this end, we review the current status of gene expression profiling in epileptogenesis and suggest standard guidelines to be followed for greater accuracy and reproducibility of results.",0
Pathological and ultrastructural analysis of surgical lung biopsies in patients with swine‐origin influenza type A/H1N1 and acute respiratory failure,"BACKGROUND: Cases of H1N1 and other pulmonary infections evolve to acute respiratory failure and death when co‐infections or lung injury predominate over the immune response, thus requiring early diagnosis to improve treatment. OBJECTIVE: To perform a detailed histopathological analysis of the open lung biopsy specimens from five patients with ARDS with confirmed H1N1. METHODS: Lung specimens underwent microbiologic analysis, and examination by optical and electron microscopy. Immunophenotyping was used to characterize macrophages, natural killer, T and B cells, and expression of cytokines and iNOS. RESULTS: The pathological features observed were necrotizing bronchiolitis, diffuse alveolar damage, alveolar hemorrhage and abnormal immune response. Ultrastructural analysis showed viral‐like particles in all cases. CONCLUSIONS: Viral‐like particles can be successfully demonstrated in lung tissue by ultrastructural examination, without confirmation of the virus by RT‐PCR on nasopharyngeal aspirates. Bronchioles and epithelium, rather than endothelium, are probably the primary target of infection, and diffuse alveolar damage the consequence of the effect of airways obliteration and dysfunction on innate immunity, suggesting that treatment should be focused on epithelial repair.",0
Temporal trends in the discovery of human viruses,"On average, more than two new species of human virus are reported every year. We constructed the cumulative species discovery curve for human viruses going back to 1901. We fitted a statistical model to these data; the shape of the curve strongly suggests that the process of virus discovery is far from complete. We generated a 95% credible interval for the pool of as yet undiscovered virus species of 38–562. We extrapolated the curve and generated an estimate of 10–40 new species to be discovered by 2020. Although we cannot predict the level of health threat that these new viruses will present, we conclude that novel virus species must be anticipated in public health planning. More systematic virus discovery programmes, covering both humans and potential animal reservoirs of human viruses, should be considered.",0
Non-Hemagglutinating Flaviviruses: Molecular Mechanisms for the Emergence of New Strains via Adaptation to European Ticks,"Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) causes human epidemics across Eurasia. Clinical manifestations range from inapparent infections and fevers to fatal encephalitis but the factors that determine disease severity are currently undefined. TBEV is characteristically a hemagglutinating (HA) virus; the ability to agglutinate erythrocytes tentatively reflects virion receptor/fusion activity. However, for the past few years many atypical HA-deficient strains have been isolated from patients and also from the natural European host tick, Ixodes persulcatus. By analysing the sequences of HA-deficient strains we have identified 3 unique amino acid substitutions (D67G, E122G or D277A) in the envelope protein, each of which increases the net charge and hydrophobicity of the virion surface. Therefore, we genetically engineered virus mutants each containing one of these 3 substitutions; they all exhibited HA-deficiency. Unexpectedly, each genetically modified non-HA virus demonstrated increased TBEV reproduction in feeding Ixodes ricinus, not the recognised tick host for these strains. Moreover, virus transmission efficiency between infected and uninfected ticks co-feeding on mice was also intensified by each substitution. Retrospectively, the mutation D67G was identified in viruses isolated from patients with encephalitis. We propose that the emergence of atypical Siberian HA-deficient TBEV strains in Europe is linked to their molecular adaptation to local ticks. This process appears to be driven by the selection of single mutations that change the virion surface thus enhancing receptor/fusion function essential for TBEV entry into the unfamiliar tick species. As the consequence of this adaptive mutagenesis, some of these mutations also appear to enhance the ability of TBEV to cross the human blood-brain barrier, a likely explanation for fatal encephalitis. Future research will reveal if these emerging Siberian TBEV strains continue to disperse westwards across Europe by adaptation to the indigenous tick species and if they are associated with severe forms of TBE.",0
Prokaryote phylogeny based on ribosomal proteins and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases by using the compositional distance approach,"

This study seeks to unravel the complexity of prokaryote phylogeny on a molecular level. Through the use of compositional distance approach, ribosomal proteins and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases are studied with the aim to construct a comprehensive phylogenetic tree. Resulting from this novel analysis, we hope to contribute new insights into evolutionary development within the domain prokaryotes.",1
Immune Mechanisms Responsible for Vaccination against and Clearance of Mucosal and Lymphatic Norovirus Infection,"Two cardinal manifestations of viral immunity are efficient clearance of acute infection and the capacity to vaccinate against secondary viral exposure. For noroviruses, the contributions of T cells to viral clearance and vaccination have not been elucidated. We report here that both CD4 and CD8 T cells are required for efficient clearance of primary murine norovirus (MNV) infection from the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes. Further, long-lasting protective immunity was generated by oral live virus vaccination. Systemic vaccination with the MNV capsid protein also effectively protected against mucosal challenge, while vaccination with the capsid protein of the distantly related human Lordsdale virus provided partial protection. Fully effective vaccination required a broad immune response including CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and B cells, but the importance of specific immune cell types varied between the intestine and intestinal lymph nodes. Perforin, but not interferon gamma, was required for clearance of MNV infection by adoptively transferred T lymphocytes from vaccinated hosts. These studies prove the feasibility of both mucosal and systemic vaccination against mucosal norovirus infection, demonstrate tissue specificity of norovirus immune cells, and indicate that efficient vaccination strategies should induce potent CD4 and CD8 T cell responses.",0
Bid Regulates the Pathogenesis of Neurotropic Reovirus,"Reovirus infection leads to apoptosis in both cultured cells and the murine central nervous system (CNS). NF-κB-driven transcription of proapoptotic cellular genes is required for the effector phase of the apoptotic response. Although both extrinsic death-receptor signaling pathways and intrinsic pathways involving mitochondrial injury are implicated in reovirus-induced apoptosis, mechanisms by which either of these pathways are activated and their relationship to NF-κB signaling following reovirus infection are unknown. The proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, Bid, is activated by proteolytic cleavage following reovirus infection. To understand how reovirus integrates host signaling circuits to induce apoptosis, we examined proapoptotic signaling following infection of Bid-deficient cells. Although reovirus growth was not affected by the absence of Bid, cells lacking Bid failed to undergo apoptosis. Furthermore, we found that NF-κB activation is required for Bid cleavage and subsequent proapoptotic signaling. To examine the functional significance of Bid-dependent apoptosis in reovirus disease, we monitored fatal encephalitis caused by reovirus in the presence and absence of Bid. Survival of Bid-deficient mice was significantly enhanced in comparison to wild-type mice following either peroral or intracranial inoculation of reovirus. Decreased reovirus virulence in Bid-null mice was accompanied by a reduction in viral yield. These findings define a role for NF-κB-dependent cleavage of Bid in the cell death program initiated by viral infection and link Bid to viral virulence.",0
Influenza Virus Infection in Nonhuman Primates,"

This article explores the prevalence and consequences of Influenza Virus Infection (IVI) in Nonhuman Primates (NHPs).

Results of this work can provide useful information for medical professionals treating similar cases.",1
Generation of Human Antigen-Specific Monoclonal IgM Antibodies Using Vaccinated “Human Immune System” Mice,"BACKGROUND: Passive transfer of antibodies not only provides immediate short-term protection against disease, but also can be exploited as a therapeutic tool. However, the ‘humanization’ of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is a time-consuming and expensive process that has the inherent drawback of potentially altering antigenic specificity and/or affinity. The immortalization of human B cells represents an alternative for obtaining human mAbs, but relies on the availability of biological samples from vaccinated individuals or convalescent patients. In this work we describe a novel approach to generate fully human mAbs by combining a humanized mouse model with a new B cell immortalization technique. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: After transplantation with CD34(+)CD38(−) human hematopoietic progenitor cells, BALB/c Rag2(−/−)IL-2Rγc(−/−) mice acquire a human immune system and harbor B cells with a diverse IgM repertoire. “Human Immune System” mice were then immunized with two commercial vaccine antigens, tetanus toxoid and hepatitis B surface antigen. Sorted human CD19(+)CD27(+) B cells were retrovirally transduced with the human B cell lymphoma (BCL)-6 and BCL-XL genes, and subsequently cultured in the presence of CD40-ligand and IL-21. This procedure allows generating stable B cell receptor-positive B cells that secrete immunoglobulins. We recovered stable B cell clones that produced IgM specific for tetanus toxoid and the hepatitis B surface antigen, respectively. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This work provides the proof-of-concept for the usefulness of this novel method based on the immunization of humanized mice for the rapid generation of human mAbs against a wide range of antigens.",0
Screening of Random Peptide Library of Hemagglutinin from Pandemic 2009 A(H1N1) Influenza Virus Reveals Unexpected Antigenically Important Regions,"The antigenic structure of the membrane protein hemagglutinin (HA) from the 2009 A(H1N1) influenza virus was dissected with a high-throughput screening method using complex antisera. The approach involves generating yeast cell libraries displaying a pool of random peptides of controllable lengths on the cell surface, followed by one round of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) against antisera from mouse, goat and human, respectively. The amino acid residue frequency appearing in the antigenic peptides at both the primary sequence and structural level was determined and used to identify “hot spots” or antigenically important regions. Unexpectedly, different antigenic structures were seen for different antisera. Moreover, five antigenic regions were identified, of which all but one are located in the conserved HA stem region that is responsible for membrane fusion. Our findings are corroborated by several recent studies on cross-neutralizing H1 subtype antibodies that recognize the HA stem region. The antigenic peptides identified may provide clues for creating peptide vaccines with better accessibility to memory B cells and better induction of cross-neutralizing antibodies than the whole HA protein. The scheme used in this study enables a direct mapping of the antigenic regions of viral proteins recognized by antisera, and may be useful for dissecting the antigenic structures of other viral proteins.",0
Mortality among patients with tuberculosis requiring intensive care: a retrospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: To describe the characteristics of patients with tuberculosis (TB) requiring intensive care and to identify the factors that predicts in-hospital mortality in a city of a developing country with intermediate-to-high TB endemicity. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective, cohort study, between November 2005 and November 2007. The patients with TB requiring intensive care were included. Predictors of mortality were assessed. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality. RESULTS: During the study period, 67 patients with TB required intensive care. Of them, 62 (92.5%) had acute respiratory failure and required mechanical ventilation. Forty-four (65.7%) patients died. Coinfection with human immunodeficiency virus was present in 46 (68.7%) patients. Early intensive care unit admission and ventilator-associated pneumonia were independently associated with the in-hospital mortality. CONCLUSIONS: In this study we found a high mortality rate in TB patients requiring intensive care, especially in those with an early ICU admission.",0
Toll-like receptors are critical for clearance of Brucella and play different roles in development of adaptive immunity following aerosol challenge in mice,"

The critical role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the clearance of Brucella and in the activation of adaptive immune responses after aerosol challenge has been addressed in numerous animal models. This study aimed to investigate how TLR2, TLR3 and TLR4 are involved in the control of and inflammatory response against Brucella from aerosol administration by mice following intranasal inoculation. To investigate this question, BALB/c mice were exposed to a range of concentrations and doses of B. abortus via intranasal exposure. Subsequently, we assessed changes amongst different cytokines profiles for all animals at multiple time points post-infection using flow cytometry grade antibody staining as well as ELISAs quantification methods. The results show that different functions arise from specific populations within each receptor's family; our findings suggest that clearance efficiency is greatly enhanced when both endogenous pathway independent expression and endosomal stimulation occur concurrently during infection with Bacterial species previously known to initiate an inflammasome cascade leading to significant downstream antigen presentation mechanisms following aerosol dissemination within host organism tissue structure. Our study therefore provides further evidence for structurally regulated divergence between innate immunity pathways initiated throughlh distinct patterns arising from macrophage recognition process involving multiple TLR protein binding sites activating defence pathways necessary during effective elimination brucella challenges inducing localization protocols primarily affected by size ,entry rate along additional external environmental factor impacting whole body progression stability either active or disable state coupled major impact period immunological challenges reduction allowing evolutionary adaptation future outbreaks preventing viral spread among preselected communities",1
In Vitro Viability and Cytotoxicity Testing and Same-Well Multi-Parametric Combinations for High Throughput Screening,"In vitro cytotoxicity testing has become an integral aspect of drug discovery because it is a convenient, costeffective, and predictive means of characterizing the toxic potential of new chemical entities. The early and routine implementation of this testing is testament to its prognostic importance for humans. Although a plethora of assay chemistries and methods exist for 96-well formats, few are practical and sufficiently sensitive enough for application in high throughput screening (HTS). Here we briefly describe a handful of the currently most robust and validated HTS assays for accurate and efficient assessment of cytotoxic risk. We also provide guidance for successful HTS implementation and discuss unique merits and detractions inherent in each method. Lastly, we discuss the advantages of combining specific HTS compatible assays into multi-parametric, same-well formats.",0
A Non-VH1-69 Heterosubtypic Neutralizing Human Monoclonal Antibody Protects Mice against H1N1 and H5N1 Viruses,"

This paper studies the efficacy of a non-VH1-69 heterosubtypic neutralizing human monoclonal antibody (NhMAbs) in protecting mice against H1N1 and H5N1 viruses. The results of this study demonstrate that NhMAb effectively prevents challenges from both viruses, which suggests its potential as an approach for treating influenza infections. By analyzing the binding specificity and epitope location, it is demonstrated that NhMAb binds to themonomeric HA at conformational epitopes not targeted by VH family 1–69 antibodies. Additionally, through testing multiple doses for survival rates and determination of serum geometric mean titers after challenge with influenza strains A/Hubei/63910/2019(H1N1)pdm09 virus or A/duck/Hunan362492502301 18 (H5N8) virusand oral oseltlmurine vaccination with NhMAb prepserum inhibitor titer was significantly higher than postvaccination sera in two mouse models challengedwith either HINIpdmon9or HIENL8viruses respectively. Collectively, our findings indicate that NhMAbis a beneficial protective agent against HINIpdm09and then more pathogenic HIENL8virusin respiratory tract mucosa when administered intramuscularly intomice models.",1
Epithelial Cell Apoptosis and Neutrophil Recruitment in Acute Lung Injury—A Unifying Hypothesis? What We Have Learned from Small Interfering RNAs,"In spite of protective ventilatory strategies, Acute Lung Injury (ALI) remains associated with high morbidity and mortality. One reason for the lack of therapeutic options might be that ALI is a co-morbid event associated with a diverse family of diseases and, thus, may be the result of distinct pathological processes. Among them, activated neutrophil- (PMN-) induced tissue injury and epithelial cell apoptosis mediated lung damage represent two potentially important candidate pathomechanisms that have been put forward. Several approaches have been undertaken to test these hypotheses, with substantial success in the treatment of experimental forms of ALI. With this in mind, we will summarize these two current hypotheses of ALI briefly, emphasizing the role of apoptosis in regulating PMN and/or lung epithelial cell responses. In addition, the contribution that Fas-mediated inflammation may play as a potential biological link between lung cell apoptosis and PMN recruitment will be considered, as well as the in vivo application of small interfering RNA (siRNA) as a novel approach to the inhibition of ALI and its therapeutic implications.",0
"Dengue Fever, Hawaii, 2001–2002","

This research focuses on the impact of dengue fever in Hawaii, 2001-2002 and its effects on risk factors for mosquito transmission and public perception. The study postulates that public health campaigns, specifically concerning prevention measures and vector control strategies, have not been enough to contain the spread of this incurable tropical disease over time. Cases soared shortly after a hurricane season which hampered clean-up procedures required to reduce the availability of breeding sites for adult mosquitoes. Findings suggest there must be significant improvements made in both local policies related to environmental protection as well as community outreach efforts designed at educating people about avoidance methods and obtaining proper diagnosis when symptoms present themselves in order to curb these outbreaks effectively.",1
Natural killer cells act as rheostats modulating anti-viral T cells,"

The modern day viruses are proving to be resilient and adaptive. Researchers across the globe, in an attempt to understand their relentless spread, have conducted many studies that shed light on the diverse ways how our body responds and tolerates their presence. In this article we discuss a particular function of Natural Killer (NK) cells which helps regulate and modulate anti-viral T Cells’ response. We will highlight the key findings from these experiments, explain why NK cells act as rheostats and suggest areas for further research.   

Natural killer (NK) cells are known critical components of innate immune system; they recognize intracellular infected agents or altered self cell even prior than lymphocytes do by recognizing non-self major histocompatability complex (MHC). During such recognition process, several cytokines including interferon γ is produced promoting anti-viral actions towards pathogens while simultaneously sensitizing other cell surface molecules that help activate cytotoxic effector functions. Our recent study demonstrated how NKs also contribute significantly by naturally controlling bystander antiviral T Cell responses when pathogens require weaker cytotoxic activity for clearing infections [1–3]. 

For better understanding of dynamics between defected virus particles inducing MHC upregulation as well as generating receptors/ligands facilitating induction of costimulatory signalling factors with subsequent modulation of antigen stimulated CD8+ T Cells upon encounter with infected tissue site; mouse model was used wherein significant differences were identified in immunodeficiencies caused either due to absence or impaired functioning of crucial defence mechanism generated after a strong activation signal from NKs i.e., IFNγ release . Furthermore, evidence suggested that lack /inhibition in perforin gene leads to highly exaggerated cytolytic signatures at peptide specific target sites[4–6] instead expected dampening influence bound to take charge owing basic nature like for instance depletion mediated half life shorting results analogous with set point regulating allosteric rheostats but ultimately constraining formation into respective quasistatic limits due reachable peak threshold magnitude even during overwhelming apoptosis dose exogenous stimuli imposed . Henceforth same was concluded based on reported case scenario where CTL influences stayed fully conserved except undetectable pronounced cytokine secretion profile corresponding certain molecular path labelled via time sequence logical antiphotoisomerization approach using laser infrared resonance spectroscopy method [7–9].

Estimating Individual and Household Reproduction Numbers in an Emerging Epidemic,"Reproduction numbers, defined as averages of the number of people infected by a typical case, play a central role in tracking infectious disease outbreaks. The aim of this paper is to develop methods for estimating reproduction numbers which are simple enough that they could be applied with limited data or in real time during an outbreak. I present a new estimator for the individual reproduction number, which describes the state of the epidemic at a point in time rather than tracking individuals over time, and discuss some potential benefits. Then, to capture more of the detail that micro-simulations have shown is important in outbreak dynamics, I analyse a model of transmission within and between households, and develop a method to estimate the household reproduction number, defined as the number of households infected by each infected household. This method is validated by numerical simulations of the spread of influenza and measles using historical data, and estimates are obtained for would-be emerging epidemics of these viruses. I argue that the household reproduction number is useful in assessing the impact of measures that target the household for isolation, quarantine, vaccination or prophylactic treatment, and measures such as social distancing and school or workplace closures which limit between-household transmission, all of which play a key role in current thinking on future infectious disease mitigation.",0

Global Surveillance of Emerging Influenza Virus Genotypes by Mass Spectrometry,"BACKGROUND: Effective influenza surveillance requires new methods capable of rapid and inexpensive genomic analysis of evolving viral species for pandemic preparedness, to understand the evolution of circulating viral species, and for vaccine strain selection. We have developed one such approach based on previously described broad-range reverse transcription PCR/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) technology. METHODS AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Analysis of base compositions of RT-PCR amplicons from influenza core gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, NP) are used to provide sub-species identification and infer influenza virus H and N subtypes. Using this approach, we detected and correctly identified 92 mammalian and avian influenza isolates, representing 30 different H and N types, including 29 avian H5N1 isolates. Further, direct analysis of 656 human clinical respiratory specimens collected over a seven-year period (1999–2006) showed correct identification of the viral species and subtypes with >97% sensitivity and specificity. Base composition derived clusters inferred from this analysis showed 100% concordance to previously established clades. Ongoing surveillance of samples from the recent influenza virus seasons (2005–2006) showed evidence for emergence and establishment of new genotypes of circulating H3N2 strains worldwide. Mixed viral quasispecies were found in approximately 1% of these recent samples providing a view into viral evolution. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Thus, rapid RT-PCR/ESI-MS analysis can be used to simultaneously identify all species of influenza viruses with clade-level resolution, identify mixed viral populations and monitor global spread and emergence of novel viral genotypes. This high-throughput method promises to become an integral component of influenza surveillance.",0
"Reporting errors in infectious disease outbreaks, with an application to Pandemic Influenza A/H1N1","BACKGROUND: Effectively responding to infectious disease outbreaks requires a well-informed response. Quantitative methods for analyzing outbreak data and estimating key parameters to characterize the spread of the outbreak, including the reproductive number and the serial interval, often assume that the data collected is complete. In reality reporting delays, undetected cases or lack of sensitive and specific tests to diagnose disease lead to reporting errors in the case counts. Here we provide insight on the impact that such reporting errors might have on the estimation of these key parameters. RESULTS: We show that when the proportion of cases reported is changing through the study period, the estimates of key epidemiological parameters are biased. Using data from the Influenza A/H1N1 outbreak in La Gloria, Mexico, we provide estimates of these parameters, accounting for possible reporting errors, and show that they can be biased by as much as 33%, if reporting issues are not accounted for. CONCLUSIONS: Failure to account for missing data can lead to misleading and inaccurate estimates of epidemic parameters.",0
Pneumonitis as A Consequence of (Peg)Interferon-Ribavirin Combination Therapy for Hepatitis C: a Review of the Literature,"Combination of peginterferon and ribavirin is the current therapy for chronic hepatitis C infection (HCV). Interstitial pneumonitis is a rare side-effect of HCV therapy and is an important cause of dose reduction or discontinuation, impairing success of antiviral therapy. We performed a review of the literature in order to present diagnostic modalities and possible treatments for pneumonitis and to offer guidelines. We searched for cases where pneumonitis as a side-effect of HCV treatment was documented. First we performed a literature search via PubMed and Web of Science interface and second we searched three drug toxicity databases. We systematically analyzed all case reports with respect to clinical manifestations, type of treatment, and outcome. A literature search revealed 19 articles, containing 25 case descriptions, while we traced 33 cases from the drug toxicity databases. Pneumonitis presented with any of the combination of fever, dyspnea, and cough and can arise with any type of (conventional or pegylated) interferon. Mortality secondary to pneumonitis was seen in 7% of cases, exclusively with peginterferon α-2b. In most cases therapy was discontinued and steroids were started. Interferon-induced pneumonitis during HCV treatment is a severe complication and should be recognized in order to prevent further pulmonary damage and/or death.",0
Multivalent HA DNA Vaccination Protects against Highly Pathogenic H5N1 Avian Influenza Infection in Chickens and Mice,"BACKGROUND: Sustained outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in avian species increase the risk of reassortment and adaptation to humans. The ability to contain its spread in chickens would reduce this threat and help maintain the capacity for egg-based vaccine production. While vaccines offer the potential to control avian disease, a major concern of current vaccines is their potency and inability to protect against evolving avian influenza viruses. METHODOLOGY / PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The ability of DNA vaccines encoding hemagglutinin (HA) proteins from different HPAI H5N1 serotypes was evaluated for its ability to elicit neutralizing antibodies and to protect against homologous and heterologous HPAI H5N1 strain challenge in mice and chickens after DNA immunization by needle and syringe or with a pressure injection device. These vaccines elicited antibodies that neutralized multiple strains of HPAI H5N1 when given in combinations containing up to 10 HAs. The response was dose-dependent, and breadth was determined by the choice of the influenza virus HA in the vaccine. Monovalent and trivalent HA vaccines were tested first in mice and conferred protection against lethal H5N1 A/Vietnam/1203/2004 challenge 68 weeks after vaccination. In chickens, protection was observed against heterologous strains of HPAI H5N1 after vaccination with a trivalent H5 serotype DNA vaccine with doses as low as 5 µg DNA given twice either by intramuscular needle injection or with a needle-free device. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: DNA vaccines offer a generic approach to influenza virus immunization applicable to multiple animal species. In addition, the ability to substitute plasmids encoding different strains enables rapid adaptation of the vaccine to newly evolving field isolates.",0
Travel Patterns in China,"The spread of infectious disease epidemics is mediated by human travel. Yet human mobility patterns vary substantially between countries and regions. Quantifying the frequency of travel and length of journeys in well-defined population is therefore critical for predicting the likely speed and pattern of spread of emerging infectious diseases, such as a new influenza pandemic. Here we present the results of a large population survey undertaken in 2007 in two areas of China: Shenzhen city in Guangdong province, and Huangshan city in Anhui province. In each area, 10,000 randomly selected individuals were interviewed, and data on regular and occasional journeys collected. Travel behaviour was examined as a function of age, sex, economic status and home location. Women and children were generally found to travel shorter distances than men. Travel patterns in the economically developed Shenzhen region are shown to resemble those in developed and economically advanced middle income countries with a significant fraction of the population commuting over distances in excess of 50 km. Conversely, in the less developed rural region of Anhui, travel was much more local, with very few journeys over 30 km. Travel patterns in both populations were well-fitted by a gravity model with a lognormal kernel function. The results provide the first quantitative information on human travel patterns in modern China, and suggest that a pandemic emerging in a less developed area of rural China might spread geographically sufficiently slowly for containment to be feasible, while spatial spread in the more economically developed areas might be expected to be much more rapid, making containment more difficult.",0
Avian influenza outbreak in Turkey through health personnel's views: a qualitative study,"BACKGROUND: Avian influenza threatens public health worldwide because it is usually associated with severe illness and, consequently, a higher risk of death. During the first months of 2006, Turkey experienced its first human avian influenza epidemic. A total of 21 human cases were identified, 12 of which were confirmed by the National Institute for Medical Research. Nine of the cases, including the four fatal ones, were from the Dogubeyazit-Van region. This study aims to evaluate the efforts at the avian influenza outbreak control in the Van-Dogubeyazit region in 2006 through the experiences of health personnel. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with seventeen key informants who took active roles during the avian influenza outbreak in East Turkey during the first months of 2006. We gathered information about the initial responses, the progress and management of the outbreak control, and the reactions of the health professionals and the public. The findings of the study are reported according to the topics that appeared through thematic analysis of the interview transcripts. RESULTS: Following the first suspected avian influenza cases, a Van Crisis Coordination Committee was formed as the coordinating and decision-making body and played an important role in the appropriate timing of decisions. The health and agriculture services could not be well coordinated owing to the lack of integrated planning in preparation for outbreak and of integrated surveillance programs. Traditional poultry practice together with the low socio-economic status of the people and the lack of health care access in the region seemed to be a major risk for animal to animal and animal to human transmission. The strengths and weaknesses of the present health system – primary health care services, national surveillance and notification systems, human resource and management – affected the inter organizational coordination during the outbreak. Open communication between the government and the public played an important part in overcoming difficulties. CONCLUSION: Although there were problems during the avian influenza outbreak in Turkey, the rapid responses of the central and regional health authorities and the performance of the health workers were the key points in controlling the epidemic. The lessons from this outbreak should provide an opportunity for integrating the preparation plans of the health and agricultural organizations, and for revising the surveillance system and enhancing the role of the primary health care services in controlling epidemic disease. Developing successful strategies based on knowledge and experience may play a valuable role in delaying an avian influenza pandemic.",0
Protein sequence analysis based on hydropathy profile of amino acids,"

This paper studies the application of hydropathy profiles to understand and compare protein sequences. By using derived profile-based parameters, we illustrate how those properties vary along sequences while allowing the discerning of evolutionary relatedness between them. To accomplish this, information from amino acid composition and physico-chemical characteristics have been incorporated into a novel computational tool producing outputs that are used together with phylogenetic clustering techniques to explore functional similarities deduced from sequence comparison. As such, our method facilitates the identification of diverse relationships among proteins or specific domains therein relating structure/function elements even when distant homologues exist.",1
Protein secretion in Lactococcus lactis : an efficient way to increase the overall heterologous protein production,"Lactococcus lactis, the model lactic acid bacterium (LAB), is a food grade and well-characterized Gram positive bacterium. It is a good candidate for heterologous protein delivery in foodstuff or in the digestive tract. L. lactis can also be used as a protein producer in fermentor. Many heterologous proteins have already been produced in L. lactis but only few reports allow comparing production yields for a given protein either produced intracellularly or secreted in the medium. Here, we review several works evaluating the influence of the localization on the production yields of several heterologous proteins produced in L. lactis. The questions of size limits, conformation, and proteolysis are addressed and discussed with regard to protein yields. These data show that i) secretion is preferable to cytoplasmic production; ii) secretion enhancement (by signal peptide and propeptide optimization) results in increased production yield; iii) protein conformation rather than protein size can impair secretion and thus alter production yields; and iv) fusion of a stable protein can stabilize labile proteins. The role of intracellular proteolysis on heterologous cytoplasmic proteins and precursors is discussed. The new challenges now are the development of food grade systems and the identification and optimization of host factors affecting heterologous protein production not only in L. lactis, but also in other LAB species.",0
PepMapper: A Collaborative Web Tool for Mapping Epitopes from Affinity-Selected Peptides,"

This paper introduces a new web-based tool, named PepMapper, for mapping epitopes from affinity-selected peptides. This simple yet powerful cloud-hosted application enables researchers to securely upload their data and swiftly predict common binding sites on poorly characterized antigens. The intuitive interface displays the input sequences and visualized antigenic sites in an automated fashion that significantly simplifies subsequent analyses of implications such as drug design or vaccine development. Results demonstrate that PepMapper accurately locates hotspot immunogenic regions with an average speed improvement of 435%, compared to current handpicked approaches. Furthermore, our platform supports collaboration among members involved in various research groups; this allows them to conduct comprehensive research by partly outsourcing tedious user interfaces while focusing more attention on results interpretation and validation. All technical specifications are provided herein to give readers detailed knowledge about how they can benefit from using PepMapper extensively within their own projects or domains",1
Open lung biopsy in early-stage acute respiratory distress syndrome,"INTRODUCTION: Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has heterogeneous etiologies, rapid progressive change and a high mortality rate. To improve the outcome of ARDS, accurate diagnosis is essential to the application of effective early treatment. The present study investigated the clinical effects and safety of open lung biopsy (OLB) in patients with early-stage ARDS of suspected non-infectious origin. METHODS: We undertook a retrospective study of 41 patients with early-stage ARDS (defined as one week or less after intubation) who underwent OLB in two medical intensive care units of a tertiary care hospital from 1999 to 2005. Data analyzed included baseline characteristics, complication rate, pathological diagnoses, treatment alterations, and hospital survival. RESULTS: The age of patients was 55 ± 17 years (mean ± SD). The average ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO(2)) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO(2)) was 116 ± 43 mmHg (mean ± SD) at biopsy. Seventeen patients (41%) were immunocompromised. Postoperative complications occurred in 20% of patients (8/41). All biopsies provided a pathological diagnosis with a diagnostic yield of 100%. Specific pathological diagnoses were made for 44% of patients (18/41). Biopsy findings led to an alteration of treatment modality in 73% of patients (30/41). The treatment alteration rate was higher in patients with nonspecific diagnoses than in patients with specific diagnoses (p = 0.0024). Overall mortality was 50% (21/41) and was not influenced by age, gender, pre-OLB oxygenation, complication rate, pathological results, and alteration of treatment. There was no surgery-related mortality. The survival rate for immunocompromised patients was better than that for immunocompetent patients (71% versus 33%; p = 0.0187) in this study. CONCLUSION: Our retrospective study suggests that OLB was a useful and acceptably safe diagnostic procedure in some selected patients with early-stage ARDS.",0
"Lost in the World of Functional Genomics, Systems Biology, and Translational Research: Is There Life after the Milstein Award?","We've always wanted to save the world from the scourges of virus infection by developing better drugs and vaccines. But fully understanding the intricacies of virus-host interactions, the first step in achieving this goal, requires the ability to view the process on a grand scale. The advent of high-throughput technologies, such as DNA microarrays and mass spectrometry, provided the first opportunities to obtain such a view. Here we describe our efforts to use these tools to focus on the changes in cellular gene expression and protein abundance that occur in response to virus infection. By examining these changes in a comprehensive manner, we have been able to discover exciting new insights into innate immunity, interferon and cytokine signaling, and the strategies used by viruses to overcome these cellular defenses. Functional genomics may yet save the world from killer viruses.",0
Crystal Structure of the N-Acetylmannosamine Kinase Domain of GNE,"BACKGROUND: UDP-GlcNAc 2-epimerase/ManNAc 6-kinase, GNE, is a bi-functional enzyme that plays a key role in sialic acid biosynthesis. Mutations of the GNE protein cause sialurea or autosomal recessive inclusion body myopathy/Nonaka myopathy. GNE is the only human protein that contains a kinase domain belonging to the ROK (repressor, ORF, kinase) family. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We solved the structure of the GNE kinase domain in the ligand-free state. The protein exists predominantly as a dimer in solution, with small populations of monomer and higher-order oligomer in equilibrium with the dimer. Crystal packing analysis reveals the existence of a crystallographic hexamer, and that the kinase domain dimerizes through the C-lobe subdomain. Mapping of disease-related missense mutations onto the kinase domain structure revealed that the mutation sites could be classified into four different groups based on the location – dimer interface, interlobar helices, protein surface, or within other secondary structural elements. CONCLUSIONS: The crystal structure of the kinase domain of GNE provides a structural basis for understanding disease-causing mutations and a model of hexameric wild type full length enzyme.

Existing health inequalities in India: informing preparedness planning for an influenza pandemic,"

This paper explores the inequities in health care provision in India and their implications for effective planning of a public health response to an influenza pandemic. Our study employs quantitative analysis to examine current levels of access to primary health services, evaluate government preparedness strategies in light of existing disparities, and investigate how inequalities might impede or enhance the effectiveness of preventive measures against pandemics. Through this retrospective research we demonstrate that existing Indian socio-economic conditions are likely to amplify the risk posed by a future influenza outbreak. Government policies must account for these pre-existing segregation between rural and urban regions if they are to construct meaningful interventions which can adequately prepare citizens in both communities with adequate healthcare resources and disease prevention education. By illuminating this vital issue, our findings could inform evidence based multi-sectoral preparedness planning at national level as well as ensure equitable distribution of public health programmes among vulnerable population groups who face disproportionate risks from pandemic threats such as those presented by an influenza strain.",1
Antiviral and Neuroprotective Role of Octaguanidinium Dendrimer-Conjugated Morpholino Oligomers in Japanese Encephalitis,"BACKGROUND: Japanese encephalitis (JE), caused by a mosquito-borne flavivirus, is endemic to the entire south-east Asian and adjoining regions. Currently no therapeutic interventions are available for JE, thereby making it one of the most dreaded encephalitides in the world. An effective way to counter the virus would be to inhibit viral replication by using anti-sense molecules directed against the viral genome. Octaguanidinium dendrimer-conjugated Morpholino (or Vivo-Morpholino) are uncharged anti-sense oligomers that can enter cells of living organisms by endocytosis and subsequently escape from endosomes into the cytosol/nuclear compartment of cells. We hypothesize that Vivo-Morpholinos generated against specific regions of 3′ or 5′ untranslated regions of JEV genome, when administered in an experimental model of JE, will have significant antiviral and neuroprotective effect. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice were infected with JEV (GP78 strain) followed by intraperitoneal administration of Morpholinos (5 mg/kg body weight) daily for up to five treatments. Survivability of the animals was monitored for 15 days (or until death) following which they were sacrificed and their brains were processed either for immunohistochemical staining or protein extraction. Plaque assay and immunoblot analysis performed from brain homogenates showed reduced viral load and viral protein expression, resulting in greater survival of infected animals. Neuroprotective effect was observed by thionin staining of brain sections. Cytokine bead array showed reduction in the levels of proinflammatory cytokines in brain following Morpholino treatment, which were elevated after infection. This corresponded to reduced microglial activation in brain. Oxidative stress was reduced and certain stress-related signaling molecules were found to be positively modulated following Morpholino treatment. In vitro studies also showed that there was decrease in infective viral particle production following Morpholino treatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Administration of Vivo-Morpholino effectively resulted in increased survival of animals and neuroprotection in a murine model of JE. Hence, these oligomers represent a potential antiviral agent that merits further evaluation.",0
The Restriction of Zoonotic PERV Transmission by Human APOBEC3G,"The human APOBEC3G protein is an innate anti-viral factor that can dominantly inhibit the replication of some endogenous and exogenous retroviruses. The prospects of purposefully harnessing such an anti-viral defense are under investigation. Here, long-term co-culture experiments were used to show that porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) transmission from pig to human cells is reduced to nearly undetectable levels by expressing human APOBEC3G in virus-producing pig kidney cells. Inhibition occurred by a deamination-independent mechanism, likely after particle production but before the virus could immortalize by integration into human genomic DNA. PERV inhibition did not require the DNA cytosine deaminase activity of APOBEC3G and, correspondingly, APOBEC3G-attributable hypermutations were not detected. In contrast, over-expression of the sole endogenous APOBEC3 protein of pigs failed to interfere significantly with PERV transmission. Together, these data constitute the first proof-of-principle demonstration that APOBEC3 proteins can be used to fortify the innate anti-viral defenses of cells to prevent the zoonotic transmission of an endogenous retrovirus. These studies suggest that human APOBEC3G-transgenic pigs will provide safer, PERV-less xenotransplantation resources and that analogous cross-species APOBEC3-dependent restriction strategies may be useful for thwarting other endogenous as well as exogenous retrovirus infections.",0
